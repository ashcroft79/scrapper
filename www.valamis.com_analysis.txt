[P] February 1, 2023·updated July 22, 2024
[P] The idea of an employee remaining in the same role for the entirety of their career seems less relevant with each passing year.
[P] Employees are now looking for more from their professional lives, and employers see benefits in helping them. Organizations can prevent burnout by introducing career development plans and keeping staff motivated with new and exciting challenges. As a company grows, so should its employees.

[H2] What is a career development plan?
[P] A career development plan is a personalized roadmap designed to help employees achieve professional goals. It typically consists of short- and long-term goals related to each employee’s specific strengths and weaknesses, their current role, future ambitions, and the organization’s requirements.
[P] While a career development plan can take several formats, they often incorporate a series of formal and informal steps an employee should undertake to improve their professional skills, increase their workplace value, and progress in their career. This could be by expanding their current role and taking on more responsibility or transitioning to a new position.
[P] The personalized nature of career development plans is crucial to their success.
[P] Every employee is unique, with different skills, strengths, and potential within a business and other wants and needs from their professional life.
[P] Organizations must work with employees to design a career development plan that benefits both parties.
[P] The following is a generalized approach to creating and maintaining a career development plan:
[LI] Starting point – where the employee is in their career and an assessment of their current skillset, values, and aspirations.
[LI] Ideal career – what they want to achieve in their career, defining specific goals and objectives.
[LI] The difference – skill gaps they need to overcome to transition from their current role to their ideal role.
[INTERNAL LINK] https://www.valamis.com/hub/skills-gap
[LI] The path – a plan to bridge the gap; this defines a written career plan with specific steps the employee needs to accomplish.
[LI] Review – as progression occurs, employees and organizations must review and reshape career development plans based on new factors.
[H2] The purpose of a career development plan
[P] A career development plan creates a written record of what an employee wants to achieve.
[P] This record can have a different purpose for employees and employers.
[H4] The purpose for employees
[LI] help them define career goals and organize/plan the steps they need to take to progress. It also helps employees understand the potential for internal mobility and how their goals align with the organization.
[INTERNAL LINK] https://www.valamis.com/hub/career-mobility
[H4] The purpose for your company
[LI] career development plans play a critical role in workforce planning and talent management, acting as a tool for HR departments to design future training programs. With a clear understanding of each employee’s career goals, organizations can work with them to achieve their potential and increase the value they generate for the company.

[H2] Career development plan template
[P] This template helps employees and leaders plan together for career growth: set goals, assess skills, and make a plan.
[INTERNAL LINK] https://www.valamis.com/publications/career-development-plan-template
[H2] Why career development is important
[H4] The importance for employees
[LI] Career development planning helps employees map out their future, organizing and identifying the steps they should take to achieve their professional goals. This includes connecting longer-term objectives with day-to-day activities, growing professionally, and setting achievable milestones.
[LI] These all help enhance motivation and improve job performance, aiding the likelihood of achieving the long-term aims of the career development plan. Sometimes just having a future goal in mind improves present behaviors to the extent that the goal itself is more attainable. For example, with a clear career development plan in place, employees can focus on their professional development and target the specific skills they need to improve.
[LI] Career development plans show employees what to do to achieve their dream job.
[LI] They also improve transparency between employees and employers. Therefore, when mutually beneficial, organizations can invest in resources (e.g., educational material, external learning opportunities, etc.) to help employees improve themselves and progress in their careers.
[P] The importance of learning opportunities and career planning and development has only increased in recent years.
[P] Glint’s 2021 Employee Well-Being Report ranked “opportunities to learn and grow” as the number one driver of excellent workplace culture, up eight spots from the previous year.
[EXTERNAL LINK] https://www.glintinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Glint-May-2021-Employee-Well-Being-Report.pdf
[P] In the past, in-person interactions were the primary driver of workplace culture. Team meals, drinks after work, and impromptu chats in the hallway are all examples of interaction significantly reduced with new remote and hybrid work models
[P] The pandemic removed the importance of in-person interactions combined with new technologies and accelerated digital transformation. It created a less certain future, with employees more concerned about job security.
[P] With more significant uncertainty, it is unsurprising that drivers of culture related to employee growth have risen in importance.
[P] Employees now want more than a paycheck and a pat from their employer. They want to perform their work while also getting the opportunity to work on themselves, developing into better employees to help reduce job insecurity worries.
[P] Career development plans and associated training programs help staff see their role as more than just a job. It is a path to a more secure or financially rewarding position.
[H4] The importance for companies
[P] Investing in employee development is critical to maintaining a vibrant and effective team. Achievers’ 2020 Engagement & Retention Report found:
[EXTERNAL LINK] https://www.achievers.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/012220_Achievers_ERR_124-1.pdf
[LI] 46% of employees feel only moderately valued by their bosses
[LI] 30% feel “not very” or “not at all” valued
[LI] 26% feel that being undervalued is the most significant barrier to becoming engaged in their work.
[P] One way to dispel these feelings is to invest in employee development, demonstrating that the company values workers. With active L&D programs, organizations can boost employee retention and hold on to their most valuable team members.
[P] LinkedIn found that 94% of employees would continue to work at a company for longer if they invested in their learning and development. For ten years, the Work Institute has ranked career development concerns as the number one reason employees leave organizations.
[EXTERNAL LINK] https://learning.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/amp/learning-solutions/images/workplace-learning-report-2019/pdf/workplace-learning-report-2019.pdf
[EXTERNAL LINK] https://workinstitute.com/
[P] Employers need to treat and guide their L&D programs with career development plans because it helps attract and retain top talent.
[P] This is before they even consider the potential performance benefits of career development programs and how they can inform upskilling and reskilling initiatives.
[INTERNAL LINK] https://www.valamis.com/hub/upskilling
[INTERNAL LINK] https://www.valamis.com/hub/reskilling
[P] Perhaps just as bad as talented employees leaving is unskilled, unmotivated employees remaining at your company.
[P] Gallup’s 2022 report on the “State of the Global Workplace” estimates that actively disengaged employees cost the global economy $7.8 trillion, 11% of the world’s GDP.
[EXTERNAL LINK] https://www.gallup.com/workplace/393497/world-trillion-workplace-problem.aspx
[P] In contrast, the benefits of high employee engagement are startling. By analyzing over one hundred thousand business units and comparing the top quartile to the bottom quartile, Gallup found:
[LI] 23% higher profitability
[LI] 14-18% higher productivity
[LI] 10% higher customer loyalty
[P] Thankfully employee development is a crucial driver of engagement, with previous studies showing that 80% of employees are more engaged when learning new skills.
[EXTERNAL LINK] https://info.udemy.com/rs/273-CKQ-053/images/2016_Udemy_Workplace_Boredom_Study.pdf
[P] Employee upskilling programs make people better at their job, boosting engagement and arming staff with the skills needed to enhance company performance.
[P] Career development plans ensure that upskilling targets people with the right skills. With individualized training based on an employee’s long-term goals, companies can build a talented, engaged, and happy workforce capable of delivering success.

[INTERNAL LINK] https://www.valamis.com/publications/career-development-plan-template
[H2] How organizations can support employee career development
[P] Career development plans benefit both the employer and the employee when implemented correctly. Therefore, you should work with your staff to help them accomplish their goals and become well-rounded, successful employees.
[P] While employees must take responsibility and drive their own career development, organizations can also create an environment conducive to learning new skills.
[LI] Developing an additive learning ecosystem that can enhance employees’ experience regardless of how they like to learn.
[LI] Providing details about the employee’s strengths and weaknesses, where they need to focus their efforts, and the outcomes they should aim for.
[LI] Considering the full range and potential of career development for a specific employee. This can mean not tunneling on hard skills that produce dramatic transformations in their capabilities but also taking into account soft, interpersonal skills such as communication and organizational abilities.
[LI] Acknowledging progress by linking career development objectives and incorporating new skills to tangible workplace benefits. This could be a higher salary based on their unique contributions or transitioning to a new, more-rewarding role aligned with their career aims.
[H2] How to create a personalized career development plan for an employee
[H3] Identify employees ready for a career development plan
[P] Producing a personalized plan for every employee is a significant undertaking, and for many employees, it may yield little value to the organization. It is always beneficial to focus time and resources where they will be most effective; this could be people who:
[LI] Show leadership potential
[LI] Have talent but seem disillusioned in their current role
[LI] Demonstrate the enthusiasm and drive to learn new skills
[LI] Want to take on new challenges
[LI] Are the highest performers in the organization
[P] Discuss with managers and supervisors from each department to identify candidates who would benefit the most from a dedicated career development plan. Reach out to the candidates and gauge their willingness to work closely with the organization and build a new career development plan.
[H3] Ask them to prepare information about themselves
[P] While it is a team effort between the organization and the employee, ultimately, the individual will drive the success of their career development plan. Therefore, you should ask them to start preparing information about their current role and what they want to achieve in their career.
[P] Essential questions for employees to ask themselves before working on a career development plan include:
[LI] What are your career goals?
[LI] Where do you see yourself in five or ten years?
[LI] What skills or experiences do you need to achieve your goal?
[LI] What is currently holding you back in your professional life?
[LI] What could your employer do to help your career?
[P] Download a Career Development Plan Template [PDF/ DOCX]
[INTERNAL LINK] https://www.valamis.com/publications/career-development-plan-template
[P] To simplify the process, employers should provide a self-assessment form containing all the information they need to start designing their career development plan. This includes questions identifying the specific skills they currently have and what they will need moving forward.
[P] The next step is to arrange a meeting between key stakeholders, the employee themselves, their line manager or direct superior, and often a member of the HR department.
[P] During the meeting, the parties should go over the information compiled in step 2 and begin to define critical components of the career development plan.
[P] This includes a clear vision of the employee’s professional interests and long-term career goals.
[P] While it is generally easier to define start and end points, the aim of the meeting should be to begin to understand the various steps along the way. This means breaking down long-term objectives into a series of shorter-term goals and how they can be achieved.
[P] Gather information on how the employee likes to learn and consider what their future L&D program may look like with input from HR personnel.
[H3] Assess what is achievable
[P] After meeting with the employee, the organization (in particular, the manager involved) needs to determine what they can achieve while working for them.
[P] That means assessing their current skills, the employee potential, and critically what the organization needs from its workforce. For example, only some employees can have a career progressing to the c-suite.
[P] Consult with relevant stakeholders and evaluate career development objectives that are achievable at the organization.
[P] Identify the resources required to help the employee progress towards their career goals and determine whether they are currently present within the organization. In many instances, you will also need to look externally (i.e., external education and learning experiences).
[H3] Work together to design the career development plan
[P] Discuss with the employee and learn how the organization could best support their career development, including the potential resources available. Then start working together to produce a realistic career development plan that helps them achieve their goals.
[P] While there are many potential forms a career development plan can take, critical factors you should include are:
[LI] The employee’s starting point (a summary statement followed by their current education, training, and job assignment)
[LI] Long-term career goals (over five years)
[LI] Short-term career goals (less than five years)
[LI] The development activities to put them in a position to achieve these goals
[INTERNAL LINK] https://www.valamis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/individual-career-development-plan-template.pdf
[P] Download a Career Development Plan Template [PDF/ DOCX]
[INTERNAL LINK] https://www.valamis.com/publications/career-development-plan-template
[P] Important tips to remember when designing a career development plan include:
[LI] Personalize – Ensure the final plan is tailored to each employee, considering their unique skillset and what they want to achieve.
[LI] Be Flexible – Remember that an employee’s aspirations will likely change during their career, especially early on. While you can design a great initial career development plan, don’t make the mistake of sticking too closely to it. If the employee finds a new passion or stumbles into an area they excel, don’t be afraid to revise the plan to consider new factors.
[LI] Tracking progress – Every plan needs to consider how the employee’s progress will be monitored. This could include incentives, such as a promotion, upon achieving a certain level of performance or demonstrating the value of the L&D investment made in them.
[P] Finally comes the exciting part of implementing the career development plan. Ensure all stakeholders are happy with the program’s current form, then let the development begin.
[P] While you can take steps to support each employee along their career development journey, success has to be driven by the individual.
[P] Make sure to check back with each employee, scheduling regular sessions to determine their progress and review any potential updates to the plan.
[P] Using learning metrics or KPIs, you must also assess employee improvements and training effectiveness. With metrics in place to track behavior, you can determine the return on investment for your L&D efforts.

[H2] When to start thinking about a career development plan?
[P] While employees should continuously evaluate their skills, workplace experience, and career progression, there are better times for employers to engage with them to produce a more formal career development program.
[P] Often a good time to start thinking about a career development plan is once an employee begins to impress management. When they have demonstrated their capabilities and become a valuable team member, management and HR should consider working on a personalized career development plan that maximizes an employee’s potential within the organization.
[P] Another good time to start working on a career development plan is after a significant milestone at the company. Perhaps they land a major client or design a new workflow to improve operations. Whatever the specific reason, by setting future development goals, you can keep essential staff motivated and engaged and prevent them from drifting or looking for a new challenge at another company.

[LI] Cross-functional knowledge
[INTERNAL LINK] https://www.valamis.com/hub/employee-development-areas#cross-functional
[P] Why it matters: Flexibility enables employees to adapt to changing circumstances, making them more resilient and valuable to the company.
[P] Tip: Adaptability is the key to an employee’s well-being and ability to thrive within the work environment.
[P] A static employee is one that will quickly become disengaged from excelling and moving forward, or worse, overwhelmed and overstressed, resulting in poor performance or an early evacuation/termination from the organization.
[H3] Ways to help in developing flexibility:
[P] 1. Job rotation: Rotate employees through different roles to expose them to various functions. 2. Agile training: Implement Agile methodologies that emphasize adaptability and quick responses to change. 3. Scenario planning: Conduct regular workshops where employees solve hypothetical problems that require quick thinking and adaptation. 4. Support networks: Often, the root cause of inflexibility in the workplace comes from a sense of feeling overwhelmed in a role.
[P] Example: Encourage employees to use Trello, Jira or Monday boards to manage different types of tasks and adapt quickly to changes in project scope or deadlines.
[H2] Career development plan template
[P] This template helps employees and leaders plan together for career growth: set goals, assess skills, and make a plan.
[INTERNAL LINK] https://www.valamis.com/publications/career-development-plan-template
[P] Why it matters: Effective communication fosters collaboration and minimizes misunderstandings, leading to a more efficient and harmonious workplace.
[H3] Ways to help in developing communication skills
[P] Managers should meet frequently with their chain-of-command employees.
[P] Additionally, as employees, it helps to hold regular touch-points with peers and colleagues to keep information, thoughts and an exchange of ideas flowing freely across the organization.
[P] Some soft skills, such as listening and picking up visual cues and interpreting body language, need to be developed through formal training.
[INTERNAL LINK] https://www.valamis.com/hub/hard-skills-vs-soft-skills#soft-skills
[P] Organizations must invest in helping employees to communicate across company hierarchy – with peers, supervisors, senior management and executives.
[P] Also, make sure you don’t forget various types of communication skills – written, oral, in-person and remote, including digital and traditional.
[H5] 3. Assigning group projects
[P] Working on group projects can also help bring out the best amongst individuals and teams.
[P] Volunteering to work on cross-team projects helps communication, promotes team spirit and offers a change to hone interpersonal skills.
[H5] 4. Cross-functional workshops
[P] Engage in different discussions and situations.
[P] Talk with people from other cultures, people with different personalities, people with different backgrounds, people in different positions in the company, etc.
[P] Learn from them and try to understand their point of view.
[P] Offering feedback, and accepting it positively, is often tough, but it can lead to positive skills and development outcomes.
[P] Delivering criticism in a positive – often private – way allows such critique to be construed less as “reprimand” and more as advice. Accepting criticism without fear that “management is out to get you!” can turn critique into a learning point.
[P] Again, present it as constructive feedback and not as just criticism. Also, encourage the two-way street of both asking for and giving feedback.
[INTERNAL LINK] https://www.valamis.com/hub/constructive-feedback
[H5] 6. Self-reflection and observing others
[P] See how you act in different social situations.
[LI] What situations make you feel uncomfortable or unable to act?
[LI] What could you do to improve your communication etc?
[P] Also, be cognizant of how other people act in different situations, maybe you can find out good tips on how to act (or what not to do) in certain situations.
[P] If you want to get more details, read our article about improving communication skills.
[INTERNAL LINK] https://www.valamis.com/hub/how-to-improve-communication-skills
[H2] Conflict resolution, tactfulness, work ethic
[P] Why it matters: These skills help maintain a positive work environment and ensure that conflicts are resolved constructively.
[P] At the same time, doing what’s morally right, and taking on ethical positions in the workplace can generate conflict. It takes skill to navigate these three – sometimes conflicting – domains.
[P] Here’s how employers and employees can work together on developing these skills for the good of individuals and the organization as a whole:
[P] Employers can nominate employees, especially those who are being groomed for leadership roles, for conflict management and arbitration training.
[INTERNAL LINK] https://www.valamis.com/hub/conflict-management-styles
[P] Veteran employees can also coach less-senior staff on how to de-escalate potentially volatile situations.
[P] Practicing listening skills, learning how to communicate during stressful situations, and mastering the art of being polite but assertive can also help diplomatically resolve workplace conflicts.
[H5] 2. Role-playing scenarios
[P] Practice real-life situations to develop tact and diplomacy.
[H5] 3. Work ethic seminars
[P] Workshops that highlight the importance of integrity, responsibility, and perseverance.
[P] Tip: Employers can aid good work ethics by creating a safe, fair and healthy working environment for all employees.
[P] Although at first blush, these may seem like disparate employee development areas examples, they are in fact highly correlated.
[P] At the end of the day, if employers and employees work jointly to develop these skills, everyone will learn to “get along better” for the greater good of the self and the organization.
[P] Leadership styles are diverse but to lead effectively there a few key skills that are common amongst good leaders.
[INTERNAL LINK] https://www.valamis.com/hub/management-styles
[P] Leadership skills are highly valued by employers; effective leaders can motivate and help others succeed within an organization.
[P] A positive leader can lift a company above the competition, while a negative leader can make the work environment a dreadful, unmotivated and withering atmosphere.
[INTERNAL LINK] https://www.valamis.com/blog/leadership-onboarding
[H3] Ideas on how to develop leadership skills
[P] To grow as a leader, it’s best to be led by another one.
[P] Offer leadership training programs that cover essential skills such as decision-making, strategic thinking, and team management. Mentorship programs can also provide valuable guidance and support for emerging leaders​
[P] Employees can volunteer their expertise – for instance taking company trainees under their wings, or speaking to a batch of novice workers at a convention, to hone some of these skills.
[P] Forming task forces, to deal with unique organizational challenges, is a great practice run for future leaders.

[H2] Organizational skills
[P] Balancing a multitude of tasks effectively and efficiently requires a specific set of skills:
[P] The answer isn’t always what’s most important now, but more so, what needs to be completed first to allow for all the other big-picture pieces to fall into place.
[P] This is part prioritization and part efficiency. By developing good habits and dialing in the daily workflow one can capitalize on all the available hours in a day.
[P] If you’ve seen a master multi-tasker it’s incredible! They’re a blur of activity, accomplishing several things at once.

[P] No one wins when meetings are missed or appointments are routinely bumped.
[P] Allot enough time for each appointment and add a little buffer time if you’re continually running late.
[P] This isn’t just working, it’s getting things done.
[P] If it’s taking you twice as long to do something as a colleague, reevaluate and get input on what’s making them so much more efficient.
[P] The key here is details. Stick to a repeatable format that answers all the questions: who, when, where and what.

[P] Lose the notion that a deadline is just a suggestion.

[H5] 3. Support employee efforts at stress management
[P] Provide access to stress counseling. As employees use these services, they’ll develop the skills to better manage stressful situations on an ongoing basis.
[H5] 4. Emphasize and train for time management
[P] Have employees take a moment at the beginning of each day to plan and prioritize.
[H5] 5. Offer a more flexible work environment
[P] One of the greatest stressors most employees face is the balancing of family and home life with work.
[P] If the work is being completed successfully and on time, don’t emphasize the traditional nine to five work schedule. Investigate alternative and hybrid models, e.g., 9/80 schedule.
