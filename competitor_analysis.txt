Engage Your Employees From Anywhere

HulerHub is a simple, flexible employee engagement platform that unites your internal comms, content, and resources alongside actionable insights into what makes your people tick.

What You Need Is What You See

One size never fits all.

Make Space For Personalisation

Internal comms made easy

I want to break free!

Less Distractions, Higher Engagement

A place for everything

Traditional employee engagement platforms don’t address the needs of a modern workforce. Distracting email inboxes, maze-like intranets and inefficient meetings get in the way of productivity every day. HulerHub minimises distractions and maximises engagement to create a focused digital work environment that keeps your people in the loop without overwhelming them.

Your people actively disengage when they don’t feel included in what’s happening across the business. The HulerHub user experience is familiar and highly visual, allowing employees to clearly find what they need and engage with content that's relevant to them.

You *can* handle the truth!

Nurture your biggest assets

You have a great plan for engaging employees and helping them perform at their best, but you need to know how they work. You could ask them, but that would be time-consuming...and you might not always get an honest answer. HulerHub provides real-time insights into the ways your people work, from their most productive times to the content they frequently interact with, so you can keep improving the employee experience every day.

Way better than free coffee.

Bespoke Mentoring Software

Huler’s team of expert L&D professionals and IT experts will work with you to create an end-to-end mentoring solution that empowers you to take control of your L&D initiatives and gain powerful, actionable insights from real-time data.

Our bespoke mentoring software makes launching effective mentoring programs with meaningful outcomes quick, easy and intuitive.

Your Mentoring Program, Your Way

Launch engaging, productive mentoring programs that get results with bespoke mentoring software.

Our bespoke mentoring software takes the pain out of building a successful mentoring program.

Our skills-matching algorithm suggests three best matches for each mentee based on their personal goals, L&D requirements, skills gaps and mentor availability.

With machine learning, this process gets more accurate and efficient over time and reduces admin input.

Through the platform, mentors and mentees can take control of their own mentoring relationship.

Mentees can send a relationship request to their chosen mentor, and get started setting agreed targets and goals.

Mentors can accept or decline mentee requests, define their availability and set their own maximum relationship number to make sure they don’t get overwhelmed.

Everyone’s talking about us, and there’s...

Nothing but love for Huler

Behind the scenes, admins can verify mentors to ensure high quality relationships, adjust global settings (such as maximum relationships) and pull detailed relationship reports to see feedback on both mentors and mentees.

Our bespoke mentoring software gives you complete control and visibility across the whole process to help you maximise results.

Quality Feedback, Meaningful Outcomes

Feedback is an essential part of a successful mentoring program. Within our mentoring software mentees feedback on their experience and contribute to the recommendation profile of their mentor, enabling more accurate future recommendations.

OverviewOur customers rely on the HulerHub platform to securely work from anywhere in the world. We understand that security and privacy is the number one concern for the organisations we work with, many of who operate in highly-regulated and security-conscious industries. Our cloud-based platform is built with this in mind, offering industry-leading protection security as standard to protect the data of your business, employees and customers. No ifs or buts.

Reliability When you work from anywhere, you need to be confident your data is available whenever (and wherever) you need it. Our systems are hosted on Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) across multiple availability zones. That way, if one ever fails, your service remains totally uninterrupted. For more information on this, please visit the AWS security page.

Under the HoodHulerHub implements a security-oriented design in multiple layers, one of which is the application layer. The HulerHub application is developed according to the OWASP Top 10 framework and all code is peer reviewed prior to deployment. Huler also employs a number of industry standards to ensure the separation of client data within a multi-tenant system. Client access to data relies on short-lived access tokens which encode the account ID the client has access to. This account ID must match the account ID of any returned records at every stage of processes. If it doesn’t, the data cannot be returned to the client. Once you’re in, HulerHub encrypts all data: Traffic is encrypted using TLS 1.3 with a modern cipher suite, supporting TLS 1.2 at minimum. User data is encrypted at rest across our infrastructure using AES-256 or better. Encryption keys are managed using the AWS KMS service. Credentials are stored within the AWS Cognito service. HulerHub then ensures consistent backups of user data to allow for Point-in-Time Recovery.

Weaving Cybersecurity into Workplace Culture

Researchers from Stanford University and a top cybersecurity organisation found that approximately 88 percent of all data breaches are caused by human error…

Cybersecurity isn’t just a tech issue—it’s a people issue. Employees are your front line against cyber threats, and embedding security into your company culture isn’t just about protecting data; it’s about empowering your team. Let’s explore how to make cybersecurity part of your everyday culture in a way that’s engaging, proactive, and people-centric.

Prioritise the Employee Experience

Most cybersecurity training feels like a compliance box to check—dry, technical, and not very relatable. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Shifting the focus to how employees experience cybersecurity can make training more engaging and relevant. Think of it as meeting people where they are, rather than forcing them through another boring slideshow.

Actionable Tip: Use engaging formats like storytelling or real-life scenarios that connect cybersecurity practices to daily tasks, both at work and home. This approach makes cybersecurity training more accessible and memorable.

Embed Security Throughout the Employee Journey

Cybersecurity should be an ongoing conversation, not a one-time event. Start the journey with onboarding and keep the momentum going through continuous development, ensuring that each touchpoint reinforces the importance of security.

Onboarding: Set the tone from day one with interactive security training that’s welcoming and informative.

Continuous Learning: Cyber threats evolve, and so should your training. Use dynamic, role-specific content that keeps employees engaged.

Offboarding: Ensure a smooth, secure exit process by promptly revoking access and conducting a thorough review of data permissions.

Make Cybersecurity a Team Sport

Creating a culture of security means making it a shared responsibility across the organisation. This doesn’t mean everyone needs to be an expert, but everyone should feel empowered to play their part.

Promote Open Dialogue: Encourage employees to speak up if they notice anything suspicious. Create a culture where there’s no fear of judgment—just a collective effort to keep the company safe.

Recognise Efforts: Celebrate employees who demonstrate vigilance. Use platforms like Huler’s Kudos to give shout-outs to your team’s cyber heroes, making security part of the company’s everyday language.

Design Engaging, Accessible Training

Ditch the boring, one-size-fits-all approach to cybersecurity training. Instead, make it fun and accessible. Think of quick quizzes, interactive videos, and gamified experiences that fit seamlessly into the workday. Tailor content to different learning styles and keep it short, sweet, and relevant.

Quick Win: Offer bite-sized sessions that employees can easily slot into their schedules. This not only respects their time but also reinforces key security concepts more effectively.

Integrate Security into Everyday Tools

Embedding security into everyday work practices is key. Use familiar tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams to push friendly security reminders and updates. Keep your guidelines up-to-date and easily accessible, so everyone knows the best practices to follow.

Smart Move: Use Huler’s platform to centralise all cybersecurity resources—policies, training materials, and guidelines—into one easy-to-find hub. This helps your team stay informed and connected.

Conclusion: Build a Resilient, Security-Aware Culture

Embedding cybersecurity into your company culture isn’t just about tech—it’s about people. By integrating security into everyday routines and putting the employee experience first, you build a resilient, proactive team that’s ready to tackle any cyber challenge. Remember, a security-aware culture isn’t built overnight, but with the right approach, it becomes a powerful asset for your company.

Landing an inspiring vision with clarity, impact and speed

“Each of us has a fire in our hearts for something. It’s our goal in life to find it and keep it lit.”

– Mary Lou Retton, Gymnastics, gold medallist at the Los Angeles Games, 1984

The XXXIII Olympic Games begin this week in Paris. The mere mention of the Olympics ignites a ‘Mary Lou Retton shaped fire’ for me and evokes memories of that wonderful summer of 2012 when Team GB inspired a nation. Since then, of course many sporting events have inspired us , but there was something uniquely special about 2012. It showcased how a group of competitive, high-performing elite athletes, often strangers and sometimes rivals, came together at a defined moment and enjoyed a culture like nothing they’ve experienced before in their respective sports. A story rich with lessons for all of us.

Over the years, I’ve often cited Team GB and the Olympics as examples of what visionary leadership and a shared purpose can achieve in any walk of life…

So, as we sit down over the coming weeks to watch our athletes compete, I urge you all to think about some of the interlinking areas (think the 5 Olympic rings!) we might be able to take lessons from and apply to our own organisations.

Creating the environment for success – It will be fascinating to see the culture Team GB has embraced for 2024. Have they empowered athletes with the autonomy to make their own decisions and take ownership of their training and performance? How have they fostered teamwork despite the inherent competition of the Games? Have they created an environment conducive to collaboration?

Personal Development – Small gains make a massive difference at any level, let alone elite. Athletes will have come to the Games after four years of relentless focus on their personal development. They will have had clearly articulated personalised development plans that align with their Olympic goals. Timing (peaking) is everything. Their objectives will have been regularly reviewed and updated to ensure ongoing challenge and growth. They will have been given space for personal reflection and some will have had mentorship programmes in places as they learnt and took advice from previous heroes. They’ll no doubt be some terrific stories post-Games on how athletes went about their training and development journeys that we can all learn from.

Resilience and Adaptability – The journey to Olympic success will always be fraught with inevitable challenges and setbacks. Who will be this year’s story of remarkable resilience and overcoming adversity?

Imparting Knowledge – Knowledge, and access to that knowledge quickly, is key in all walks of life, but especially in sport. Coaches will have imparted knowledge to athletes about every strength and weakness of their likely opponents. It’s fair to say no stone will have been left unturned to try and give athletes every possible advantage as they seek to win a medal. Coaches will have done everything they can to ensure athletes have the right information when they need it and have done all the prep necessary to execute flawlessly.

Recognition – During all their preparation for Paris, coaches will have placed a big importance of celebrating and recognising competition wins and milestones. And that kudos will have inspired athletes to push even harder in their training. At Huler, we believe ongoing recognition is so important. So much so, that throughout the Olympics (and Paralympics) we will be giving our own kudos to athletes by celebrating rare achievements through our social media feeds. That significance could be a world record, a gold medal or an act that is simply inspiring.

The one message I am clear about before the Games begin, and that I speak to HR leaders about every day, is that if you have an inspiring vision, whether you’re the head of Team GB’s 327 competing athletes or a leader of a FTSE 100 organisation, you need to land that inspiring vision with clarity, impact, and speed. Talent on its own is not enough and leaders need to create the right environment, support, habits and culture.

That’s what breaks records.

Thank youDavid KellyDavid Kelly

Introducing the HR Leader’s guide to human-centred change

Are you an HR leader feeling overwhelmed by the constant pace of change and the pressure to support your employees through turbulent times? You’re not alone.

The rapid advancements in technology, the changes to our working environments, and ongoing economic and environmental shifts are creating new challenges that demand innovative solutions.

Yet when it comes to approaching and delivering change, too often we still rely on traditional methods… It’s no longer about just ‘managing change’ it’s about bringing your people on the journey with you, inspiring and mobilising them to come together, embrace, and jointly ‘own and drive’ transformation.

That’s why we recently created our guide that has been designed to support HR leaders in navigating change and transformation using a more forward-thinking and human-centred approach. We explore the biggest challenges affecting you and your peers today and offer ways to provide a more seamless, personalised and engaging experience to your people, (rather than overwhelming them with projects, applications and notifications’).

And when it comes to technology, we talk about the effects of system overload, offering practical ways of ensuring that your technology works with you rather than against you when it comes to landing your change agenda.

It’s time to move from ‘change management’ to ‘sparking a movement’

So why are traditional methods no longer fit for purpose?

Traditional ways of delivering change and landing strategic messaging may no longer be fit for purpose. For a start, change is now constant, so running it as an end-to-end programme is obsolete; rather change is a wave we all need to learn to ride as comfortably as possible. Most HR leaders will have a change programme on their ever-growing to-do list, and these can often be viewed as discrete projects. But from an employee experience perspective, this is not necessarily how your people will see them.

Rather, they are likely to just view it as part of their overall employee and work experience. This is why we must move on from ‘managing change’ to ‘sparking a movement’, inspiring our people to come on the journey with us and co-creating the future.

Is your tech working for you or against you?

Approaching technology in the wrong way can be more of a hindrance than enabling, particularly when it comes to landing change, so how do you make sure to work with your tech and not against it? If your people don’t know where to find information or how to engage with your communications, how can you be sure that any of your messages are landing? Not to mention the fact that spending more than a quarter of a working day searching for content is damaging productivity, something no organisation can afford in such challenging and fast-moving times.

Ripping out technology and starting again is clearly not an option. Focus on making the best of what you already have, and ensure good communications, relevant signposting and content aggregation is at the forefront of your thinking.

It’s time to land your strategic agenda with clarity and impact

When it comes to helping you cut through the noise we like to take into account 5 important principles that enable organisations to prioritise employee needs, enhance the employee experience (particularly during challenging and uncertain times), and simplify their systems.

Happy employees, happy customers: Aligning employee and customer experience

Customer experience (CX) has been a core strategic focus of organisations, particularly consumer-facing ones, for decades now. But the concept of employee experience (EX), although becoming something of a trending topic in HR circles in recent years, has traditionally lagged behind.

This in many ways is shortsighted of leaders as there is no getting away from the fact that EX and CX are inextricably linked. The experience of employees will have a profound impact on their ability and motivation to provide a brilliant customer experience, so it’s time for businesses to stop viewing and addressing them in isolation and instead recognise the symbiosis, making alignment between EX and CX a strategic priority.

In fact, research by Forbes Insight and Salesforce found that 70% of executives believe improved EX leads to improved CX, and that those companies with both high CX and EX see almost double the revenue growth as those who do not.

Bridging the EX & CX gap

When it comes to delivering an exemplary customer experience, the fundamentals start with the employee day-to-day experience. After all, you cannot expect your people to deliver an exemplary customer experience if their day-to-day experience at work is clunky and frustrating.

Far too often we prioritise customer interactions with a view to reducing the load, but overlook the fact that employees are often treated as ‘second class citizens’ when it comes to layering system on top of system, with outdated technology and processes at the core. It’s unlikely then that an employee, however intrinsically motivated, will deliver an empathetic and high-touch service to customers if they aren’t treated well by their employer.

Industry reports support this…

Research by MIT Sloan has found that companies in the top quartile of EX developed more successful innovations, deriving twice the revenue from innovations as those in the bottom quartile, and their Net Promoter Scores (NPS) were also twice as high.

And think about it: empowered and motivated employees are more passionate about their work and the company they represent. This translates into genuine interactions with customers, fostering loyalty and trust in the brand.

Create champions from within

In our latest report we delve deeper into the links between CX and EX, and explore practical strategies you can start using today to start building better organisation for your people, and for improving customer experience.

Here’s a sneak peek into how you begin to align CX & EX:

Your EX needs to stack up to promises offered through any employer brand activity and external customer marketing too. Authenticity is key. But ensure you nail EX internally before you start shouting about it externally.

Use technology to make your people’s lives easier and empower them to deliver great customer experiences. Above all, ensure your people have the tools to do their jobs well.

Help everyone understand how they contribute to CX.

Not all of your people will be in customer-facing roles, and those in more ‘back office’ or functional roles may struggle to see how they contribute to CX. Help connect everyone to the customer by asking customers questions at different points along the journey (for example, how much did the UX or UI of the product influence their buying decision) to help your teams understand how they contribute to CX.

Want to know more? Download our report to access key insights into bridging the gap between CX and EX, plus practical actions, tools and templates that will help you to build a stronger culture, deliver an exemplary customer experience, and see fast revenue growth.

Meta to Discontinue Workplace: Welcome a future-proof alternative

Earlier this month, Meta announced the discontinuation of Workplace, its enterprise communications platform launched in 2016. The service will continue in a read-only mode until May 2026, following its official cessation in September 2025. This decision impacts approximately 7 million users, who are now directed towards partner-recommended alternatives that may not be a perfect fit for every organisation.

This transition therefore presents a much needed opportunity for businesses to rethink and innovate their internal communications strategies for the future.

Navigating Change in a Rapidly Evolving Industry

The discontinuation of Workplace is just another example of the rapid evolution within the enterprise communications sector. Change is often costly and disruptive, prompting the question: how can businesses future-proof their operations?

Leaders must prioritise effective communication, impactful change management, and ongoing employee engagement. Simply side stepping to another messaging platform may not be the optimal solution.

HR leaders in particular are operating in challenging times. Many organisations are struggling to keep pace with the macro shifts in the external environment and in particular the pace of technological development impacting how they operate, are structured, drive value and – in many cases – even survive. We are living and working in an era of constant change.

What if we instead looked to integrate our existing technology, rather than side step to a like for like comms platform? Instead we left room for the future, enabling the ability to evolve and reform, hassle free! Organise, centralise and personalise.

The stats speak for themselves:

Deloitte reports that integrating workplace platforms with other business tools can streamline processes, reducing project completion times by 30%. (Deloitte)

Better yet, Employees save an average of 8 hours per week by using collaboration tools that streamline communication and project management (TechRepublic).

Business’s face the challenge of digital overload or better known as digital fatigue, employees are jumping through hoops to access the correct resources and tools at the right time. This constant switching was found to result in a 40% reduction in overall productivity (American Psychological Association).

What does this tell us? It’s time to cut down the noise, listen and deliver.

Embracing a New Vision for Workplace Communication

Now is the time to envision a more comprehensive and adaptable solution. Imagine if employees could design their own workplace communication tools.

Huler offers a forward-thinking approach to workplace communication and engagement. It focuses on enhancing performance, managing organisational culture, and revolutionising learning and development (L&D). This platform empowers employees and strengthens HR’s value proposition, Huler may not be a direct alternative to Workplace, but an upgrade for those looking to future-proof, personalise and revolutionise. Welcome to a digital knowledge hub that supports creative development, helps bridge the gap between HR and the business, and brings forward and to life strategic agendas clearly and at pace.

We are not for those looking for another glossy intranet…

The Huler Advantage: Beyond Messaging

Huler provides the perfect entry point to all of your systems and existing communication tools like Teams and Slack, adding a layer of full visibility and hyper-personalisation. Hulerhub empowers employees and boosts performance by centralising and organising information in a user-friendly, visually appealing interface.

One of Huler’s standout features is its ability to facilitate both internal and external communication through collections. Users can create and share content collections related to specific projects, themes, or topics, making it invaluable for onboarding, client pitches, alumni relations, and broader business ecosystems. Huler’s design ensures simplicity, impact, clarity, engagement, and aesthetic appeal.

Lets face it, it’s time that our EX journey starts to use the same type of messaging, personalisation and ‘storyboarding’ that you would expect of your customer focussed digital tools.

Easy Implementation and Positive Feedback

Implementing Huler is straightforward and hassle-free. Its plug-and-play setup eliminates the need for prolonged IT involvement, allowing for swift adoption.

By choosing Huler, organisations can future-proof their communications infrastructure, enhance employee engagement, and support HR’s strategic goals. So, it’s not just about replacing Workplace; it’s about transforming how we think about workplace communication and collaboration.
