Ann Summers used Thrive to learn how to do sales enablement right. With the help of Thrive's vast array of content options, they created a dynamic, blended learning programme for their sales staff. They knew that more in-depth learning led to better sales, but now they had Thrive's data and analytics functionality to back it up. Through an experimental blended learning programme that utilised Thrive's sales enablement capabilities, Ann Summers saw a 10% increase in sales for their "Buzz Fresh" and hosiery product lines.

Real results we can measure together

From off-brand to on-point

Prior to partnering with Thrive, Reissâ learning platform was extremely limited in terms of functionality, and it simply didnât inspire them. With their teamâs professional progression at the top of their priority list, they had no choice but to search for a new vendor.

They had a few concerns when it came to switching learning platform providers; most importantly, the smooth migration of their learning data.

And unsurprisingly, there was plenty of data to migrate.

Reiss is a global operation, with 1,600 members of staff spread out across retail and head office locations. In looking to leave behind the platform they had now outgrown, it was absolutely essential to Reiss that their next vendor have the capacity to handle a large migration in a smooth and stress-free way.

This is when their research brought them to Thrive: The all-in-one, AI-powered LMS with a proven track record of successful implementations for teams of all sizes.

26,262 in the first month

1293 in the first month

Finding their signature style

Just like crafting a luxurious capsule wardrobe full of beautiful pieces (something Reiss knows all about) planning the first steps of an effective learning strategy requires you to decide exactly what your priorities are.

So other than a smooth implementation, which is a must for any impactful learning platform transition, what was important to the team at Reiss?

Career progression was a huge priority for Reiss. They wanted to ensure that every single member of staff felt valued and nurtured in their roles, and that they had all the tools they needed to succeed.

Why Thrive? With advanced âSkills and Goalsâ functionality, Thriveâs customisable platform is designed with learners in mind. They can select the areas of progression that theyâre interested in, and Thrive will create a custom learning pathway to help them reach their goals.

Prior to launching Thrive, one of Reissâ pain points was the time it took to onboard new starters. In making the transition, they wanted to prevent this process needlessly eating into time employees could be spending getting to grips with their roles.

Why Thrive? With seamless onboarding pathways that can be tailored to each learner, role, department or organisation, Thrive is designed to make employeesâ introductions to the company as efficient and effective as possible.

A simplified tech stack:

Instead of having their comms and learning spread out across multiple platforms, it was important to have everything consolidated in one central place.

Why Thrive? Thriveâs all-in-one LMS combines skills, learning and comms in one intuitive platform and offers hundreds of integrations â perfect for consolidating your tech stack. â

A sense of belonging and collaboration:

Reiss wanted to develop a deeper sense of belonging amongst their people, celebrate their differences, and increase collaboration throughout the business.

Why Thrive? Thriveâs all-in-one platform encourages collaboration with communication features that are designed to bring people together. This is enhanced by Thrive Content: the off-the-shelf service that provides hundreds of thoroughly-researched resources on belonging, inclusion, allyship and more.

A boutique learning experience

What does a timeless outfit have in common with an effective learning platform? Sometimes, simplicity is key. This is exactly what Reiss aimed for when launching Thrive: One, simplified central place where all their learning and comms could be stored â and that goal has already been realised.

On top of this, within just a few months of launch Reissâ initial objectives of faster onboarding, career progression and belonging are starting to fall into place.

Having left their previous platform behind, Reiss is ready to Â fully lean into Thriveâs AI capabilities, and make use of the new suite of tools and features. The AI search function and WhatsApp coach will deliver dynamic and instant answers instantly â so their people can spend less time searching, and more time progressing in their roles. Meanwhile, the AI authoring tool will allow their admins to create unique learning content in multiple formats within a few clicks.

Real results we can measure together

Prior to Thrive, Science Museum Groupâs learning engagement was in need of a new definition.

âLearningâ was a word that only described the mandatory training that employees had to log on and complete once a year, and âadditional trainingâ referred simply to a traditional, classroom-based approach facilitated by expensive external trainers.

The SMG team needed to shift their peopleâs perception of what learning could mean, be, and do for them. As a group that prides themselves on inspiration and education for everyone, the unengaging L&D strategy wasnât going to cut it moving forwards.

In searching for a new learning platform, SMG was looking to modernise and create value for money. But more importantly, they wanted a real culture change; to create a strategy that saw people actively take control of their own learning.

So, out of all the learning platforms out there - and there are plenty - what ultimately led Science Museum Group to choose Thrive? There were a few reasons, the first being the fact that the platform was so easy to use. Klaudia Mitura (L&D Manager at Science Museum Group) knew that the group needed something that would feel seamless for their team, echoing the digital apps like Amazon and Netflix that people use every day. The team wanted learning that was as easy, accessible and intuitive as choosing what to watch on the TV.

Thriveâs modern, agile interface filled that gap perfectly.

The second reason was the sheer range of learning opportunities within Thrive. With establishing a new learning culture as their primary objective, SMG knew that their teams would respond well to accessible micro-moments of learning that they could complete in the flow of work.

Their compliance training and onboarding procedures would also get a shake-up, resulting in a bigger impact on the business as a whole. â

Back-end support for the Front of House

The well-oiled machine of Science Museum Group runs so smoothly thanks in part to their 120-strong customer-facing team: A department that serves as the face of the operation and interacts with hundreds of visitors every single day. This team deserved their own unique learning strategy running alongside the company-wide learning to help them excel within their roles, and deliver world-class customer service.

The Front of House team is headed up by Paige (Assistant Visitor Experience Manager.) Sheâs taken Thriveâs capabilities and run with them, recognising that the bite-sized, micro modules are the perfect size to jump into between customers. There are a few innovative elements of Thrive that have resulted in a successful training strategy, and more staff members than ever being fully up-to-date: â

1. Standardisation of training: The onboarding pathways provided by Thrive result in a standardisation of training across the whole team. Paige can be sure that every member of staff is coming to their additional training with a solid foundation, having completed the same onboarding pathway as a new starter.

2. Managersâ View: The Managerâs View feature allows Paige (and all SMG managers) a holistic view of their teamâs individual progress. They can easily see who has completed their training, along with a total percentage of completion across the entire team, and how to achieve 100%.

3. Customer service: The core of Paigeâs team and role at SMG. Paige has utilised Thriveâs pathway functionality to create an insightful customer service training programme titled âInspiring Service.â This provides new starters with standardised customer service training that has been crafted with SMG visitors in mind, helping Front of House to deliver customer-led, visitor-focused service to everyone who walks through their doors.

A curated L&D strategy

This purposeful, curated learning strategy has led to results that SMG can feel proud of. Hereâs just a few ways Thrive has impacted the SMG team:

1. User Generated Content: Science Museum Group has fully embraced Thriveâs UGC capabilities, with 39 collaborations between 110+ content experts. Together, these internal Subject Matter Experts have been able to share their knowledge with the entire organisation. 2. ROI: SMG has seen some incredible return on investment for their Learning & Development offering. They can use Thriveâs Skills and Goals feature to capture learning needs across the organisation; effortlessly detecting skills and knowledge gaps in teams, and for individuals. Theyâve done away with the expensive external trainers and classroom-style learning, doing a big favour for their bottom line. 3. Engagement: Thrive has served as a massive boon to Science Museum Groupâs learning culture. There is a monthly average of over 8,000 pieces of content being accessed, a quarter of which are non-mandatory learning. The learners are benefiting hugely from this culture shift, and itâs showing no signs of slowing down.

Real results we can measure together

ââThe AA Driving Instructor Training Academy had thousands of trainee instructors on the books, with account managers handling hundreds of people each. Their aim was to give each of their learners the best, most consistent experience and opportunities for success, no matter where and when they chose to learn. And with so many trainees to keep track of, they had their work cut out for them.

While trainees were enthusiastic about becoming franchised instructors, the process itself had a few issues. Firstly, the task of obtaining each traineeâs information proved too lengthy. Next, to become a franchisee could take anywhere between 18 months and 2 years to complete.

All of this combined led to uninspired trainees, and the team observed a lot of people beginning the course but not finishing it. Or worse still, some would register but never even start.

The abundance of useful information provided by the AA was not best served in the long, text-based handouts it took the form of, across multiple channels. This medium hardly inspired the sense of fun, ease and engagement that the AA wanted to instil in their trainees.

Mark Born (Head of the AA Driving Instructor Training Academy) knew there was a better way to deliver their important information, and actually make it land. Something needed to change in order for the AA Driving Instructor Training Academy to fully embody the companyâs motto, and truly be âready for anything.â

75% customer growth achieved in last 12 months with Thrive

2,222 training resources hosted on platform

300,000 content views in 2023

âWith a desire to shift their communication from various Facebook groups to one central and internal platform, the need for social learning, and a commitment to giving their driving students the very best instruction possible, Thrive was the obvious choice for AAâs next steps.

In launching the platform, the AA Driving School had clear goals they wanted to achieve. They could plainly see the issues that needed fixing in their current processes to help their course material shine through in the way it deserved: trainees could not identify what was expected of them, or easily navigate the courses themselves. âOn top of this, a lack of interaction with the brand left trainees feeling relatively disconnected. The AA wanted to see an uptick in instructors completing the courses to a higher level, provide a clearer structure, and encourage communication.

In order to give their instructors the very best start possible, the AA needed to harness Thriveâs functionality and bring their courses into the future.

"[Thrive] works so hard for our trainees to make sure that they can get the best resources, the best updated videos, the best updated information that they need throughout their journey."

- Farideh Sarvari, Driving Instructor Trainerâ

âThrive has been instrumental in helping the AA bring their Driving School up to the same standard as the rest of their impressive portfolio.

Transferring the training materials onto the digital platform, Thrive and AA worked together to make every step as engaging and effective as possible. Hosting a range of videos, quizzes and PDFâs, the platform provides flexibility for every individual learner - no matter their needs or learning preferences.

Trainees are now regularly interacting with AA-branded content, meaning they feel more connected to the business than ever before.

For every solution the Driving School sought, Thrive had features to suit. â

The AA has left the struggle of keeping track of their trainee instructors in the past. With Thriveâs Managerâs Dashboard feature, they can follow along with their progress and offer them any extra help when needed. â

Communication and social learning

Gone are the disparate Facebook groups the AA was using to communicate with their trainees. All communication has now shifted to Thrive, meaning everything is in one central place. The platform has provided a clear course structure, in a concise and easy-to-understand way.

The platformâs social-media-like functionality means that not only is it easy to use, but the trainees actively want to. It seamlessly mimics the effortlessness of platforms that people are already used to in their personal lives, encouraging trainees to like, share and comment on the learning materials that matter most to them.

The move has helped to foster the sense of community the AA was aiming for: now, the team has created individual communities within the platform to support trainees at each stage in their journey towards gaining the qualification. Whether itâs to celebrate success, seek support, connect with peers going through the same process, or share best practices from those who have already succeeded, the platform has successfully brought trainees together.

2,222 training resources are now hosted on the platform, with a total of 501,592 content views and counting. The sense of social learning and knowledge sharing the AA set out for has been achieved, with the platform boasting 2,687 likes, 2,851 shares and 8,014 comments since launch. Â

Altogether, this has resulted in the AA succeeding in their goal of helping trainees achieve a higher level than before the launch of Thrive. â

How does learning directly lead to customer success?

Since AA has been using Thrive to deliver their valuable learning material in the best possible way, their instructors can then provide the best and most consistent customer service to their students. As a result, the AA has achieved 75% customer growth in just 12 months, and gained a Platinum Feefo Award for outstanding customer service.

Mark believes this achievement to be thanks in part to Thrive:

"We're really proud of the fact that we've earned a Platinum Feefo Award, which means we've had gold-trusted service for the last three years. The fact that we've got the learning platform really helps us with that, because the engagement is always there. We can always have those conversations, and give everyone that visibility. Thrive has absolutely helped us with those Feefo awards."

- Mark Born, Head of the AA Driving Instructor Training Academy

âAs the customer base grows, so does the team. The AA has hired their first ever Community Manager to own all communication through Thrive, and help achieve their goal of strengthening the driver community.

Thriveâs ongoing customer support means that the AA can feel safe in the knowledge that they always have someone in their corner. Working together, they have plenty of ideas about how to continue getting the most out of their platform.

Next on the agenda: the AA hopes to shorten the amount of time between sign-up and course completion. Using Thriveâs comms tools and with the help of their new Community Manager, they want to develop their community even further - uniting their budding instructors from all over the country.

Real results we can measure together

What do we want to be known for?

Adele Spencer (Head of L&D) and Steven Park (Digital Learning Manager) knew their digital learning strategy needed an overhaul. They began by taking stock of what they already had, and using that information to figure out exactly what they needed. They asked themselves the question:

âAs a learning function, what do we want to be known for?â

Their existing platform took a traditional, compliance based approach. While this meant that most of their team received the necessary training, it didnât fit within the bold digital learning strategy they envisioned. Along with a lack of inspiration and innovation, the platform simply wasnât fit for purpose: a SharePoint based site with a distinct lack of licences, some of the workforce couldnât even access it.

They could clearly see the current platform wasnât going to help them reach their goal as a learning function: to be inclusive, engaging, and accessible to everyone. They wanted a platform that would truly support this vision, and bring their workforce together from all over the world.

A new taste for training

Steven had worked with Thrive at a previous company, and so he knew what Princes could achieve using the platform. His research continually returned him to Thrive: a partner with whom heâd built a strong, productive relationship. This ultimately helped them stand out from the crowd. Thriveâs functionality, features and entire ethos Â just seemed to slot perfectly into what Princes needed, making the partnership a no-brainer.

93% adoption rate in 12 months

Over 3,000 active users across UK, EU & Mauritius

Over 100,000 content views

All the ingredients for a perfect partnership

Transitioning to a new learning platform can be a stressful process. With existing data and learning history to migrate, apps to integrate, and the implementation to complete, there are a lot of plates that need spinning.

Luckily, Steven and Adele knew they were in safe hands.

Thriveâs thorough, structured approach was exactly what Princes needed to make sure the entire transition went off without a hitch. With their very own Implementation Specialist, a dedicated Customer Success Manager, and regular face-to-face meetings, the Thrive team acted as an extension of Princes - and from day one to launch, everyone was on the same page.

To take care of all the technical details, Thrive worked together with Princesâ key stakeholders and made sure that Steven and Adele could focus purely on the learning.

One of the main objectives when launching the platform was to encourage better communication and collaboration between every single Princes employee. They wanted to make sure that everyone felt truly a part of the brand, and Thrive has allowed them to do just that.

Using Thriveâs Broadcast feature, Princes holds a bi-weekly event called Food for Thought.

During this company-wide event, people from all over the business are brought together virtually to discuss the various projects, business initiatives and ideas that are helping to keep Princes at the forefront of their industry.

From sustainability efforts in Mauritius to European packaging methods, knowledge is shared with absolutely everyone in the company - so no matter their department, people feel connected to every facet of the operation.

This regular event has helped to encourage the sense of knowledge-sharing and collaboration that Adele and Steven had hoped for when embarking on the launch of a new platform.

Itâs made even better with the Thrive Mobile App. For factory operatives and other deskless employees, regularly interacting with Princesâ content and branding via the app helps them to feel connected to the business, instead of simply doing their job in a vacuum.

One of the most impactful innovations within the business has been the welcome move towards âpullâ learning, instead of just âpush.â In other words, Princesâ learners are now able to decide for themselves when and what would be most helpful for them to learn, instead of simply being told what to do. â

Through the use of Thrive Content - Thriveâs off-the-shelf content solution with thousands of pre-made resources - Princes can be confident that their learning content is consistently fresh, exciting and relevant to their end users. Princes even contributed to Thrive's Food and Drink Manufacturing content suite, so the partnership is going from strength to strength. Thrive keeps ahead of the news and trends within L&D, meaning Princes is also always one step ahead.

Going forward, Adele and Steven plan to use Thrive to achieve a people-driven culture at Princes. Through mapping soft skills to company behaviours and values, they hope to set expectations for the way they want people to communicate with one another.

And with Thriveâs Skills and Goals functionality, managers can use 1:1âs to identify areas for improvement before sending employees in the direction of relevant learning pathways.

The partnership with Thrive has been so successful that Princes even uses it as a part of their recruitment strategy. In Adeleâs words:

âWe tell new candidates that we use Thrive as a platform, because we see it as being an attraction tool for helping us get people that we want on board with us at Princes.â

Weâre thrilled Princes chose Thrive as a key ingredient in their recipe for learning success.

Leigh Academies Trust

Education for everyone

Leigh Academies Trust is a vast, wide-reaching organisation with no plans of slowing down. The trust comprises 31 schools made up of 20,000 students, and it was essential that their learning platform was able to support this scale - even as it grew.

Richard Taylor (People and Communications Director) and Adam Waters (Learning & Development Manager) knew their current learning platform wasnât up to the standard they needed for their staff: Adoption was low, and as an organisation with learning at the very heart of their mission they needed a learning platform that reflected that.

More learning completions in first 2 weeks of Thrive compared to 1 year of using previous platform

An unfair competition

Knowing that the marketplace was crowded, Richard decided to speak to his peers in other academies to gain recommendations for their sector - and Thrive kept coming up in the conversation.

The multiple reviews were too much to ignore, and after seeing Thriveâs impressive roster of customers Richard and his team booked a demo.

The highly personalised and accessible demo from Account Executive Danny Braithwaite was, in Richardâs words, âunfair for the competition.â Danny helped the Leigh Academies Trust team visualise their learning and development strategy in a vivid and tangible way, answering every question they had and even building them their own portal full of all the information they might need going forward.

Finally, the price transparency and value for money clinched the deal.

- Richard Taylor, People and Communications Director at Leigh Academies Trust

Going into the partnership with Thrive, the team at Leigh Academies Trust had some understandable concerns about the sheer scale of their operation. Would the all-important implementation go to plan, and launch successfully in time?

The power of a successful implementation

A successful and smooth implementation of Leigh Academy Trustâs new learning platform was the key to pulling off a September launch.

The turnaround was tight. With all their teachers coming back from summer break for the INSET Day in September, the platform needed to be up and running to support their staff in the new academic year. Not only that, but it was extremely important to Richard and his team that the teachers would not return to a blank platform. It needed to serve as an inviting, engaging prospect packed with helpful content for their teachers.

The process was made easy with Thriveâs laser-focused, structured approach; a match made in heaven for a meticulous operation like Leigh Academies Trust.

Steps for a smooth implementation

So, how did Thrive and Leigh Academies Trust approach this crucial step in the process? There were a few key factors that contributed to a smooth, seamless implementation. â

Thanks to their personal Account Executive Danny, the implementation started early - during the sales process. Through the highly personalised portal, the team was able to get to grips with the functionality so that when it came to the implementation itself, they could navigate their way around the platform with ease.â

Dedicated Implementation Specialist:

With a dedicated Implementation Specialist in Georgia Avery, Richard and his team could relax knowing that a typically stressful task (i.e. migrating everything onto a new learning platform and rolling it out to thousands of staff) would be made easy. Georgiaâs approach was purposely hands-on, which allowed her to collaborate with the trust and show them exactly how to handle each step.

And thanks to the early access they had to Thriveâs wealth of resources, they were able to take their training into their own hands to understand every facet of the platform before launch. â

Working together to establish needs and time-frames:

Throughout the entire implementation process, Thrive stayed in close contact with the team to make sure they were supported every step of the way. It was important that everybody understood what was needed, the expected time-frame, the steps to take post-launch, and the success metrics by which to measure them. Their Thrive Customer Success Team helped them establish what was important to them, including user completions, engagement, User Generated Content and social interaction.

Thriveâs implementation team served as an extension of Leigh Academy Trustâs internal team. The trust leant on their experience and knowledge to get everything done in a timely manner - and thatâs how together, they were able to pull off a September launch.

At the moment of launch just before INSET Day, the team crossed their fingers and held their breath as they hoped for a smooth roll outâ¦

â¦ Luckily, the launch went off without a hitch, allowing the Leigh Academies Trust team to breathe a sigh of relief.

With students to teach, lessons to plan and a never-ending stream of homework to mark, teachers are incredibly busy people. The Leigh Academies Trust team had some trepidation that the learning platform would serve as just another item on their ever-growing to-do list - but luckily, their concerns were put at ease upon the launch of Thrive.

It was clear from the get-go that their teachers and staff truly understood the value of the platform, immediately engaging with the content that came pre-loaded thanks to the team at Thrive Content. The teachers could use the two INSET Days to focus their attention on their own learning before turning it to their students.

Richard and his team wanted to make sure they created a buzz around the launch of Thrive, and cement in peopleâs minds that this was completely different from the uninspiring platform theyâd left behind. They kicked things off by uniting everyone with competitions and interactive challenges, which got the staff engaging with the platform from day one.

Results that canât be ignored

Engagement was at the top of their list when it came to success metrics - a factor that had been sorely lacking with previous platforms.

Richard reviewed the analytics two weeks post-launch, and noticed that in just those two short weeks, they had gained more learning completions than in an entire year using their previous platform.

By Richardâs own estimate, this is thanks to Thriveâs ease of use. Staff simply enjoy using the platform, meaning that they are regularly completing both essential learning and courses theyâve sought out completely independently.

For an organisation whose staff are spread out across multiple academies and counties, it was imperative that the platform help bring them together in a safe online space. Thrive was the only platform that allowed the trust to do this with ease, and encouraged the social engagement and knowledge sharing that they knew was essential to their learning strategy.

Fundamentally, this is what the trust is about: Learning and development. â

Time is their teacherâs most precious resource, so it was essential that any training went towards saving it. Thrive allowed them to introduce compliance training in a new, engaging format that could be quickly and thoroughly completed. This allowed the teachers more time to focus on localised issues when they returned to work.

Measuring effectiveness

Thriveâs Data and Analytics allowed Richard to hone in on his learnersâ behaviour, truly analyse the effectiveness of the learning, and adjust accordingly. Within his Thrive Analytics Dashboard, he could see how many people were active, within what period, and behaviours broken down into time slots.

The team could then leverage this data to understand which academies within the trust were engaging with the platform well, and who needed more guidance. â

How do you ensure a successful implementation continues post-launch?

With their dedicated Customer Success Manager Steph and an entire Support team at their disposal, Leigh Academies Trust is able to tackle any issues that might arise - no matter how big or small.

Real results we can measure together

A platform in need of renovation

The majority of Homebaseâs 5,600-strong team are customer-facing; their jobs entail assisting customers, dealing with stock, and solving queries as quickly as possible.

This incredibly agile workforce needed a platform that travelled the floor with them - not something that could only be accessed via one single computer in the back office.

As Homebaseâs previous LMS was not mobile-enabled, busy team members were pulled off the shop floor to use the storeâs designated computer - wasting their own time and keeping customers waiting.

Plus, the interface was clunky and difficult to navigate with onboarding compliance courses that left learners feeling uninspired. For an industry as fast-paced as retail, in a shop as popular as Homebase, this slower way of doing things just wasnât going to cut it.

The L&D project team headed up by Richard Hanman (L&D Business Partner at Homebase) knew that Homebaseâs platform should be as fluid and adaptable as its workforce, and allow them to access crucial content quickly.

It was time for their digital learning strategy to get a makeover.

25,000+ learning pathways completed in the first 6 months of launch.

Customers spend 35% more in stores that are trained to âexpertâ level vs. the average.

A fresh coat of paint

As experts in renovation and improvement, Homebase knew where to begin when overhauling their learning strategy: they started with a shopping list.

They knew their requirements were:

Role-specific training

With these necessities in mind, Thrive looked to be the perfect fit for Homebase. The two things that initially piqued the Homebase teamâs interest were the platformâs ease of navigation and its mobile app. They knew it was non-negotiable that their learning platform worked perfectly on mobile, a must-have for their majority deskless workforce.

With their people at the heart of everything they do, Homebase wanted to make absolutely sure that Thrive was the best platform for their workforce. They rolled it out to a test audience of a select few learners before launch, and after a successful trial period Thrive got two (green) thumbs up.

The overwhelming feedback was that Thrive was extremely easy to navigate, and worked brilliantly on both desktop and mobile. (Tick, tick, tick!)

The team loved that it put the power back in the hands of the learners, and took training out of the managerâs office. Plus, managers could finally check individual learner analytics and data within the platform - something their previous LMS was sorely lacking.

What finally clinched it for them was the first-class support from the Thrive team, which continued throughout implementation, launch and beyond.

Planting the seeds for professional development

From day one to one year in, Homebase is committed to helping their team members flourish.

This all starts with a seamless onboarding experience, which Homebase has streamlined since launching Thrive.

Gone are the dry, boring compliance courses that were tedious for new starters to click through. Instead, theyâve been replaced by modern, engaging compliance content from the team at Thrive Content: Thriveâs off-the-shelf learning content solution.

Compliance is now effortlessly woven into the onboarding process and has become so much more than just a box-ticking exercise.

Finally, Homebase has compliance training that people actually want to complete.

For existing team members, Homebase makes sure to nurture their professional development in the way that best benefits them. Apprenticeship training, digital courses, on-the-job learningâ¦ Whatever it may be, Thrive has enabled them to supercharge this aspect of employee engagement with specific campaigns and pathways.

Homebase is so passionate about its peopleâs professional development, the first campaign they launched within Thrive was called âLearn at Work Month.â Initially, this was to give everyone the confidence to log in and navigate Thrive, but also to showcase the extra-curricular training that was available for team members.

Homebase has teams both in support offices and in the stores - but the customer-facing frontline teams make up a very large percentage of the workforce, and are the faces of the operation. While those in the support office can access Thrive from their desktops, those on the shop floor need to be able to track down required learning quickly (without a mad dash to the managerâs office!)

In this respect, Thrive has been - in the words of the Homebase team members - a âgame changer.â An immeasurable amount of time is saved by team members being able to take the information on the go and access it from their pockets in two simple clicks.

Across the board, feedback from the Homebase team has been brilliant.

ââIâm loving Thrive, itâs changed my life. Whenever I get asked to do a bit of training, Iâm straight on it!â

âSuch a leap forward from our previous platform!â

âAmazing. All works great with iPhone and Android.â

The success of Homebaseâs launch of the Thrive platform is easily quantified thanks to Homebaseâs continuous collection of customer feedback. Every time a customer shops with Homebase, there is a link to complete a satisfaction survey on the back of the receipt.

What the team has found from this data since launching Thrive has been eye-opening.

The stores that have more team members trained to the âexpertâ level within Thrive consistently gain 35% higher satisfaction scores than those who donât.

This clearly communicated to the Homebase team that the more knowledgeable the customer service teams are, the higher the rating the customer tends to give for that visit. Not only does this knowledge increase customer satisfaction, but it even increases the average customer spend.

Homebase just launched Thrive six months ago, and already theyâre seeing fantastic results. The L&D team within Homebase is keen to keep this momentum going, and use Thrive to its full potential to help their teams achieve success.

Theyâre going to start building role-specific pathways for merchandisers and buyers, both of which are roles that have never before had any formal training. The Homebase team is excited to use Thrive to plug this gap, cultivating everyoneâs professional development.

Aside from role-specific training, they are also planning to streamline their platform so that itâs even easier for their teams to use - in the words of Julia Turner (Digital Learning Specialist at Homebase):

âWe want to make sure team members can get where they need to in a matter of seconds. Thrive is set up perfectly to provide that.â

âThe service we got from our previous supplier was one of the reasons we chose to move away and look elsewhere, and I have to say the service and support weâve had from Thrive, right from day one, has been absolutely first-class.â

Inspired Entertainment

Time to level up their learning

Prior to launching Thrive, the Inspired teamâs learning and communication materials were spread out across email, a traditional LMS, and 50-60 page customer service handbooks.

This inconsistent and old-fashioned style of learning didnât match their vibrant, innovative and forward-thinking company ethos. Communications would often get lost in the shuffle - and for their incredibly busy 60-strong customer service team, thumbing through a handbook with a customer on the other end of the phone wasnât an efficient way to do their jobs.

They needed a learning platform that was as forward-thinking as their company: something that would bring their learning out of the past and beyond a box-ticking compliance exercise, into the bold future theyâd envisioned.

Not just another company

Laura Ramsden, Head of L&D at Inspired, knew that the companyâs learning platform needed to match their own innovative ethos - and Thrive turned out to be the perfect fit. Lauraâs early interactions with the team at Thrive made it clear to her that it would be a supportive, successful partnership. â

- Laura Ramsden, Head of L&D at Inspired

Throughout implementation and launch, Laura and her team recognised that their first challenge was changing the existing impression everyone had about the companyâs learning culture. With Thriveâs help, they wanted to reinvigorate their teams - and bring the gamification on which theyâd made their name into their learning strategy.

In order to get everyone involved from the very beginning, Laura rolled out a competition across the business to name the platform and win a prize. After the votes were counted, âiLearnâ took the crown - and Inspiredâs hyper-personalised learning platform was born.

The team loved how it reflected their brand, and how easy it was to continue that branding throughout the platform with features like âiDiscoverâ, âiLead,â âiQuestionâ and âiEvents.â

Hitting the skills jackpot

Learning at Inspired has been supercharged - with a strategy that has their learners feeling as though theyâve hit the jackpot.

With such a large and varied team, it was always imperative to Inspired that their learning platform cater to a diverse range of needs. The fact that Thrive facilitates content in multiple formats means that no matter how someone learns, they wonât get left behind - and the skills and goals functionality helps people level up in their careers.

Inspired has taken this functionality and run with it, rolling out âSkill of the Monthâ in order to regularly introduce the entire business to new skills they may need to develop. Topics like âFlexible Thinkingâ and âHaving Difficult Conversationsâ have proved invaluable to a company who actively encourages continuous development and upward mobility.

Rachel Hughes, Customer Support Manager at Inspired

112,368 content views since launch

574 comments on the iLearn platform

80% of the Inspired workforce has an active licence

Achievements unlocked

As a games and entertainment company, Product underpins everything Inspired does - and Thriveâs communication features make it easier than ever for the Product team to share new game releases, marketing materials and trailers to keep everyone abreast of whatâs upcoming.

Inspired has teams in the UK, US, Europe and India, and so they saw launching iLearn with Thrive as the perfect opportunity to bring everyone together on one central platform. The iLearn homepage is buzzing with activity, and is the place to go for news, updates, and communications from all areas of the business.

Instead of emails getting lost under the digital rubble, company wins are given a place to shine - so that everyone can celebrate one anotherâs achievements together. And with Thriveâs collaboration features, two people from different sides of the organisation can connect and collaborate on relevant projects.

From level one to expert

Everyone knows starting a new job can be overwhelming - and Inspired really wanted to make sure that their players felt a part of the company culture right from âLevel One.â Instead of a quick onboarding process that simply introduces them to the basic expectations of their job role, new starters are met with a comprehensive pathway that provides a consistent experience to every single member of staff. This is complemented with job-specific training, to give them a well-rounded introduction.

This doesnât just stop after onboarding. Inspired continues to develop their people throughout their career, setting up monthly observations with team leaders where they can set out a development path. The framework helps everyone progress through their professional goals with smaller, bite-size objectives.

iLearn gets the high score

The engagement with iLearn has so far been fantastic. The team have found using the platform to be like second nature, making use of both the desktop version and the mobile app to help them take their learning on the go. The User Generated Content functionality makes it easy for everyone to feel like they have a voice and contribute to the platform, and the leaderboards make learning competitive - perfect for a gaming company!Inspired is a hugely ambitious company in terms of growth, and the ability to see whatâs happening throughout all areas of the business makes everyone feel invested.

Real results we can measure together

Centralising a place for learning & communication

MyTutor wanted to provide wider access to a range of development opportunities for their 300+ people and as they were scaling so fast, they needed to overhaul Google Drive and streamline their learning into one place that would allow their staff to learn, connect and upskill.

96% active users and 4K separate logins within the first 6 months

35K content views and 13K content completions within the first six months using Thrive

Over 13K social interactions on company messages and posts within their first 6 months

A blended onboarding experience

âAfter considering a range of different LMS's, the team at MyTutor knew they needed something with a second-to-none user experience that would help them deliver engaging and blended learning journeys. Artheka Sivaharan, Learning & Development Lead at MyTutor, commented: â[Thrive] just stood out from the rest with how the Learning Platform looked and felt.â Since deciding to implement Thrive, the team at MyTutor has overhauled onboarding from a PowerPoint to an interactive learning pathway packed with different blended resources and events. They can now easily track completions, communicate policies and connect people to each other in one place - meaning their new starters are getting up to speed faster!Â

Bringing in Thrive Content

âIn order to meet the demand for content the business was craving, the team at MyTutor needed an off-the-shelf learning solution along with their Learning Platform. But their requirements for volume needed to be backed up by quality, and more importantly be relevant to and engaging for their people. Enter Thrive Content.Â With interactive quizzes, an extensive range of titles and media available and a service to map learning campaigns and pathways, they knew this would be the solution. It not only fills their content gaps, but they also have the support to map and create learning journeys which now make up 50% of their Learning Platform.

Artheka Sivaharan, Learning & Development Lead at MyTutor commented:âI would describe Thrive ContentÂ as having an extra person in the L&D team because of the easy access to training that's been produced to such a high standard.â

âSupercharged supportâ

âGetting implementation right was key for MyTutor to get off to a flying start. The team at Thrive not only delivered training through interactive workshops, but helped carve out a marketing campaign for launch to ensure the best interaction from the get go.Â MyTutorâs Platform is instrumental to keep employees up to date, engaged and informed with upskilling opportunities, business updates, and career progression. Since Go Live theyâve seen 96% adoption, 13K social interactions, 35K content views, and 13K+ content completions with an impressive 3,600 logins during this period.

The numbers speak for themselves, and learners feel like their personal development plans can come to life in a way that wasnât available to them before.

Middlesbrough College

Personalised learning at scale

As the largest college in Teesside with learning at the heart of what they do, Middlesbroughâs main objective when looking for a new learning management system was to create a culture of self-driven learning amongst staff and faculty. After careful consideration of the market, Middlesbrough College chose Thrive to supply them with a modern-day LMS individually tailored to their 1,200 learners.

With a strong focus on delivering an engaging onboarding experience right from day one, Middlesbrough College wanted a digital solution to get new staff up to speed and fast. Natalie James, Workforce Development at Middlesbrough College, commented:

Transforming compliance training

Since launching Thrive, the team at Middlesbrough College has overhauled their existing induction process and replaced it with interactive pathways. With blended resources and events, the pathways are the perfect way for employees to work through their own learning at their own pace. Furthermore, the college has managed and tracked essential compliance training such as Safeguarding, E&D awareness, Health & Safety and more with total ease, ensuring their auditors have the reporting they need and all employees are up to date.

90% platform adoption rate within the first 3 months

165K+ Content views by users

100%Â completion of crucial compliance topics such as Safeguarding

Since Thrive has been deeply ingrained within the College, the impact and results have been impressive. With 165,000 content views, a remarkable 90% platform adoption rate, and nearly 100% of learners completing crucial topics such as Safeguarding, Middlesbrough College can confidently assert they have achieved compliance goals.

Bringing in Thrive Content

Lastly, Middlesbrough College also embedded Thrive Content, a valuable off-the-shelf content library that provides learners with relevant and practical content on important topics such as equality and diversity, information security, LGBTQ+ awareness, safeguarding, data protection, health and safety, fire safety and more. This comprehensive solution enables Middlesbrough College to bolster their learning pathways and deliver impactful training that truly engages their staff and encourages positive behaviour change.

âWeâve seen many different platforms on the marketplace but we knew we needed something thatâs so much more than just an LMS. Thrive has helped us revolutionise our learning culture here across our staff population, learning is now something you are an active owner of and you drive yourself rather than something thatâs done to you.â

Building a âgo toâ place for learning

As a collaborative organisation, SoPro identified a need for a platform that would enable them to make their learning accessible and encourage peer-to-peer knowledge sharing. Learning was taking place across different teams, but there was a lack of consistency which meant there were silos that needed breaking down. The team identified Thrive as a partner to help them on their journey, and loved the early exploration sessions where they were able to hone in on exactly what was going to help them succeed.

98%Â user adoption since starting with Thrive

Over 60,000 content views

Over 500 content shares

Scaling up onboarding and talent mobility

The company has been growing fast, bringing a new set of challenges for the team to meet. Since August 2022, they've welcomed over 150 new starters with a globally-consistent 'welcome' pathway to introduce them to the business.

With information on the business culture and values, well-being & inclusion initiatives, teams, offices and the structure of their first 90 days, new starters are immediately given the tools they need to hit the ground running.

Welcoming large numbers of employees meant they had to facilitate faster speed to competency, and look at reducing the overall cost of onboarding. Â

The team was also keen to enable skill development within the organisation - both for the roles people are already in, but also to help employees move into new areas across the business. Thrive has given them the tools they need to make this happen - and SoPro has run with it. Offering toolkits designed to prepare line managers and employees for career conversations, they've set their people up to excel in their chosen career paths. It's safe to say these toolkits are a success, amassing 1,500 views.â

User generated content

SoPro already had a desire within the leadership team to enable user-generated content and peer learning across the teams. With Thrive in place, itâs much easier for them to encourage UGC - and theyâre consistently finding that they donât have to work hard to get people using the platform. Â A great early example has been a video competition run through the platform, which was based solely on users generating and uploading their own content.

Wellbeing, diversity and inclusion

In an effort to cultivate a culture of wellbeing, diversity and inclusion, SoPro has allocated specific 'Wellbeing Champions' within the business who can provide non-judgmental, confidential chats to anyone who might be struggling.

Utilising Thrive's custom-built pathways on these very topics, the team at SoPro train their people in the topics that matter most to them as a business. Everything takes place within the Thrive platform, so it's easy to access and refer back to later.

The results for these specific campaigns have been phenomenal, garnering over 7000 views - and the engagement with the platform overall have been just as impressive. Since launch, SoPro has gained 500 comments, over 400 shares, nearly 3,000 likes and over 60,000 views.

2025 targets for diverse dispersed teams

âWirral Council has ambitious targets to meet in 2025, and wide-scale transformation plans around the delivery of services and regeneration of key areas. To realise those, the L&D team wanted people to be curious, empowered to develop their potential, and confident enough to â#BeTheDifferenceâ. But in a 2021 survey, only 56% of their employees felt they had good opportunities to grow. There was a disconnect between their people and the experts around the organisation. Their old LMS had limited capabilities, content was hard to find, and a user experience feedback form signalled one thing: it was time for an upgrade.

Used Thrive to help educate 4,000 remote workers

Average user is viewing 15 pieces of unique content a month

80% user adoption within the first 4 months

âThe team set out to âcreate a culture of innovation and learning by fostering an agile and growth mindset.â This would then feed into a strong internal talent pipeline, built by enabling personalised, self-directed learning, free-flowing knowledge sharing through user-generated content, and simple, slick, Council-wide collaboration. With remote teams to consider, tech held the answer, and they found it in THRIVE. They named their new, fully branded platform âFLOâ (Flexible Learning Online) because it makes learning easy to access, impactful and engaging - all in the flow of work.

âSince launching at the beginning of 2022, FLO has become the place to be at Wirral Council in order to develop your knowledge and skills while connecting, collaborating and sharing with others.Before, the L&D team had to push learning. Now, theyâre simply enabling it by using FLO to put personalised, bite-sized resources at their peopleâs fingertips. Featuring content from Thrive, other top providers in the industry, and Wirral Councilâs own experts, FLO is a one-stop-shop for multiple learning resources.Â

Thriveâs mobile app means all their employees can access those opportunities wherever they may be, and by creating a culture of self-directed, social learning, FLO has given Wirral Council all the tools they need to smash their targets come 2025.

From tired LMS to Thrive

For doughnut and coffee lovers (so thatâs everyone, right?) Krispy Kreme needs little introduction. But with over 1,800 learners, operations in over 115 locations, and factory stores in key cities including Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol, Edinburgh, Newcastle and Leeds, they needed a Learning Platform that engaged their people and filled the holes in their dinosaur LMS; a platform that would become intrinsic to their learners' daily routine - and stop their eyes glazing over. Enter Thrive.

99% adoption rate by users within the first 6 months of using Thrive

610,685 content views by their learners since go live

1,985 content shares by their staff helping to encourage others to learn and grow

Compliance data was a big issue

Krispy Kremeâs old learning platform wasnât providing the level they required. In a culture that prides itself on employee engagement and high performance, they wanted to enable self-driven learning, collaboration and knowledge sharing in one, co-created place.

"We felt confident we were making the right decision"

We already had a great relationship with the Krispy Kreme team, because theyâve been using Thrive Content since April 2019 to share bite-sized learning resources in the flow of work. That meant theyâd already experienced the Thrive service - and they already knew the platform would be a great fit. From there, moving over to Thrive became a no-brainer, and with plans to expand to over 3,000 learners in the future, weâre delighted to give everyone at Krispy Kreme a learning experience that has them licking their lips!

Real results we can measure together

With cutting edge technology at the core of Yopa's business, their outdated Moodle learning management system just wasnât keeping up. They needed something new to help shift the way their business viewed learning and development.

Embedding social learning

With over 350 users, Yopa Property comprises a range of teams dispersed across the UK, including self employed, field-based local estate agents and two office locations for internal customer service and support function staff. They needed a way to drive engagement, bring scattered knowledge together and create a sense of community between teams, especially amongst their self-employed staff. Â

Social learning was the answer, and Thrive was the learning platform to help them achieve it. Enabling and empowering a new way of learning, Thrive ensures knowledge is streamlined and shared amongst teams. Yopaâs Director of Learning and Development Angela Toghill commented:

80% engagement rate from their users

3,900% increase in views since moving from Moodle to Thrive

4,000+ content views in the first 2 weeks

To be confident their new learning platform would land with modern learners, Yopa knew it had to be easy to use. The user experience needed to be simple and intuitive so it wouldnât only empower their people to consume useful content, but encourage them to share knowledge through their own user generated content. Angela Toghill commented:

Following a smooth implementation, the brilliant L&D team at Yopa planned a jam-packed launch campaign to give Thrive the best start possible. The campaign kicked off at their annual âSmall Change, Big Gainsâ roadshow, where they introduced YopaThrive by branding brunch boxes and talking about the objectives for the new platform in a company wide digital event.

Achieving results from day one

Yopa ran challenges and competitions throughout their launch campaign, including finding hidden emojis amongst content and learner of the week. All of this activity resulted in a winning start to the launch of their new LMS, including an 80% engagement rate and 4,000+ content views in the first 2 weeks. Thatâs a 3,900% increase compared to Moodle, their previous LMS. Itâs safe to say the team at Yopa are embracing social learning. Information is no longer siloed; itâs shared, celebrated and available for everyone to find wherever theyâre working. We canât wait to see what this inspirational company achieves next.â

Real results we can measure together

With over 1,000 frontline retail employees in the UK alone, Ann Summers needed to give them on-demand access to learning opportunities and key communications. Employees also needed the ability to connect and collaborate with their peers from day one, through onboarding and beyond.

Sales increased by 10%Â for stores using Thrive in a A/B learning test.

Learners using Thrive exceeded business target strike rate of 20%.

Ann Summers has a 98% adoption rate.

Measuring up for a snug fitâ

âWith so many employees who arenât desk-based, a solution that works as effectively on mobile as it does on a laptop was a key priority for the Ann Summers team.Â Â

Add to this bite-sized, visual content that their employees can engage with at their own speed, and they found the perfect fit for their learning culture in Thrive.â

More collaboration. More opportunities to learn

âWith Thrive every new employee receives a personalised, frictionless onboarding experience, giving them access to the learning content they need to perform and progress their careers from day dot. Whether theyâre in head office or on the shop floor, Ann Summersâ teams can connect, collaborate and learn from each other round the clock in an organic, social, user-driven way.

âInnovative. Revolutionary. Fresh.â

âAnn Summersâ Learning & Development Partner Becky West said:

Having now been fully embedded with Thrive for over a year, Ann Summersâ engagement level amongst their learners has remained at an impressive 98%.

Throughout their journey with Thrive, Ann Summersâ L&D team noticed an important correlation: stores with the highest engagement rates demonstrated the highest level of performance. The opposite was also true, in that the lowest performing stores had the lowest engagement rates.

Knowing that they needed conclusive data to prove this correlation to their stakeholders, they levelled up their partnership and approached the team at Thrive Impact.

Armed with years of experience in Data and Analytics, the Thrive Impact team visited Ann Summersâ head office for an on-site workshop. Together, they discussed the businessâ objectives and how Thrive Impact could help achieve them. This was not simply limited to L&D goals, but encompassed anything the business needed to achieve. After analysing the existing metrics and data, the decision was made to undertake a blended learning experiment. â

A culture of experimentation

The aim of the experiment was simple: develop high performing teams who can deliver outstanding customer experiences. Ann Summers knew that their stakeholders would be compelled by an increase in strike rates for their Buzz Fresh and Hosiery lines, so they set out to demonstrate that their learning and development strategy could support them in achieving just that.

Existing strike rates: 14.8% on Buzz Fresh and Hosiery

Targeted strike rates: 20% on Buzz Fresh and Hosiery - with the exception of Region 2, which has a target of 22%.

For the experiment, Ann Summers stores were split into four regions, with Region 2 (The Test Group) receiving a slightly higher target than the others. All other regions were under the umbrella of The Control Group. While the Test Group received a blended learning approach comprising workshops, webinars and learning pathways, the Control Group only received the learning pathways. As the Ann Summers team was able to provide sales data for all regions, the Thrive Impact team could directly track the impact that the blended learning approach had had on the Test Group - and, hopefully prove that Learning and Development was the key to their success.

The success of the experiment was easy to see and quantify. All regions (both those with the blended learning approach, and those with just the learning pathways) saw a year-on-year increase for both product lines. Most importantly, the Test Group who were undergoing the blended learning approach outperformed all other groups in the experiment for the Buzz Fresh line, and came in second place for the Hosiery lines.

By doing this experiment, Ann Summers were able to measure a 10% increase in revenue with Region 2 making Â£3,617 (over 36%) of that revenue - proving undeniably the positive impacts of their approach.

Following the success of the experiment, Ann Summers and Thrive have been collectively shortlisted for Best Use of Learning Analytics at the Learning Technologies Awards 2023. Meanwhile, the team at Ann Summers continues to implement the culture of experimentation fostered during the Thrive Impact experiment, both within the Thrive platform and more widely across the organisation. Theyâre enthusiastic about the âtest and learnâ culture, so they can consistently improve and grow.

Ann Summersâ annual turnover has hit Â£100 million in 2023, and they have plans to open even more stores in the coming months.

Real results we can measure together

A sensory slice of the islands

Â To truly honour the heritage of their menu and take their guests on a sensory journey, they had to connect their teams. Thrive allowed them to give them seamless access to the content, recipes and training they need, on demand and in the flow of work.

Their old LMS wasnât to their taste

âBefore moving to Thrive, Rum Kitchen was using Litmos LMS. But the platform wasnât easily customisable, the user interface was clunky, and the close-knit customer support Rum Kitchen craved just wasnât there. So they started to look at upgrading to a platform that was intuitive for their mostly Gen-Z learners; empowering them to create and share their own content and interact with each other, with the ability to customise learning pathways. It had to be accessible on any device, with support for a rich array of multimedia formats, and it had to provide personalised recommendations to give their people valuable skills and product knowledge, whether theyâre in the kitchen, on the bar, front of house, or on the move.

The average user views 19 pieces of content a month

82%Â user adoption within the first 6 months of using Thrive

All restaurants have used Thrive to achieve a 5* hygiene rating

âThe answer? Thrive.

By using our next-gen learning platform, Rum Kitchen made content like menus, recipes, allergen charts, knife skills, food safety and hygiene training instantly accessible to their people in one, digital place. In an industry that faces tough compliance measures and random hygiene spot checks, this is particularly important - and now, all of Rum Kitchenâs restaurants have been awarded a 5-star hygiene rating.

Continuous knowledge sharing

Rum Kitchen has also used Thrive to support their development paths named âThe Rum Agesâ, making sure their people could continue to progress and develop, even when they were physically apart through lockdown and limited opening hours. Thrive has also been used to connect The Rum Kitchenâs teams around the companyâs story and brand values. Campaigns including Black History Month highlight whatâs important to Rum Kitchen and its Caribbean culture, encouraging people to share their own ideas, content and inspiration in the process.

Real results we can measure together

A partnership based on culture

With a closely aligned mission to meet the needs of the modern learner, Thrive was chosen to help deliver a scalable, social and user-driven learning strategy.

âDriving up engagementâ

Scalability was important to the team at Ballyâs as the workforce grew, which meant that learner engagement was a key metric to see how effective their Learning Platform was. Previous learning technologies and training initiatives hadnât achieved the levels of engagement that the team was hoping for. Enter Thrive.Â

Shortly after implementing Thrive, the team quickly saw an increase in levels of adoption and users exploring the platform, and feedback from the learners showed that the user experience of the platform was key to this.

37% average cost reduction in learning per hour

Time to onboard staff dropped by 40%Â vs their previous learning platform

10,000 content views a month with 92% being user generated

Streamlining employee onboarding

âAs such a large organisation, successful onboarding at Ballyâs is a crucial part of the overall employee experience. With Thrive in place, new hires were given access to all the information they needed, packaged up in a way that made it personalised and relevant to them.

In addition, they were able to explore the platform based on their own interests and aspirations. Feedback from managers showed that new hires felt informed rather than overwhelmed, and the result was that they were up to speed and performing much quicker than previously.

The power of user-generated content

âAs part of their move to a more modern learning experience, Ballyâs was keen to remove the top-down, manager-led approach to delivering learning. Instead, they wanted to give their learners the tools and permissions to share their own content with their peers. The results spoke for themselves, and within the first month following implementation, over 100 pieces of content had been uploaded and shared within the workforce.

âWith a lean L&D team and tight resources available, it was important to Ballyâs to prove the impact that the new Learning Platform was having on the business. The results were clear early on, and they found that within the first two months of using Thrive to deliver their learning, the average cost per learning hour had been halved.â

Bringing in Thrive Impact

ââBringing in Thrive meant that the Ballyâs team had a lot more data on their learners and how they were engaging with learning initiatives. But lacking an in-house way of interpreting the data meant a missed opportunity to make more informed decisions and add more value. So they brought in Thrive Impact - Thriveâs customer-only service that provides experts from marketing, data and design - to help. For a fraction of the cost of an analyst, they found that the data team were able to help them make the switch from basic reporting to addressing real business challenges through their learning strategies.Â

âLooking to the future

ââBallyâs is a large organisation which is scaling fast, and continuously having to adapt to industry changes and trends. With those challenges at the forefront, the L&D team is focusing on ensuring their people are upskilling in the right areas and equipped to meet the needs of their clients. They plan to continue to build on their modern approach, using Thriveâs engaging user experience to deliver targeted and personalised learning to their global workforce.

Real results we can measure together

More than just mandatory training

Until recently, mandatory training had dominated the learning agenda at Staffline - but it was time for a change. They needed to offer more technical, role-based learning as well as leadership and soft skills training for their 2,000 employees.

How Thrive met the challenge

Stafflineâs current compliance system was no longer meeting the needs of the business, or their learners. They wanted a new, modern learning platform that would implement a self-led learning culture while focussing on:

âSelf directed learning at the point of need

âUser-generated content

âModern learning experiences, with UI and UX that will wow their employees

âCampaigns to help them market learning and make it engaging

âTrack learner history for line managers to encourage performance conversations

Together with Staffline, Thrive helped to deliver a slick, fully-branded learning experience platform that emulated the look and feel of social media channels, rather than a traditional LMS.

Barry Davison, Head of Learning and Development, called it

to describe how much Thrive helped them mirror the experiences their employees have in their personal lives.

That doesnât only apply to look and feel; Staffline now offers a personalised approach to learning that uses AI to recommend relevant content to each individual.

9,000 content completions one month after launch

71%Â engagement rate from their users within the first month of using Thrive

All staff now have complete control of their learning plan and career development within Thrive

The L&D team at Staffline ran a campaign titled âLearning is about to change in our businessâ 6 - 8 weeks before launching Thrive, in order to build intrigue and excitement for the roll-out. They also put together a focus group of learning influencers to get people talking, collect feedback and spread their marketing messages around the organisation. They launched in September 2020, and learners picked it up so quickly that they saw a 71% engagement rate and 9,000+ content completions in their first few weeks.

Now everyone at Staffline has control of their learning plan and career development. The team plans to maintain their high engagement rates, while driving usage through campaigns and their team of learning influencers.

Real results we can measure together

With employees spread across the UK, Europe, India and Canada, the creative company needed a learning platform to surface employee expertise and share it across the entire company, connecting those in different locations.

When looking for a new learning solution, Sumo found the more traditional learning management systems didnât have the social features they needed to fulfil their vision. Their key objective was to cultivate a culture in which learners are teachers, and everybody can take ownership of their own personal development. They also required a platform that could become their workplace hub for leaders to get their message out to the whole organisation.

Additionally, as a gaming company, UI and UX are at the heart of Sumo. So, it was crucial their learning system was engaging, easy to use and intuitive. They put a few learning platforms to the test and set out on a Thrive pilot with 45 employees. Jenny Muhlwa, Learning and Development Manager at Sumo Group, commented:â

Over 125,000 pieces of content have been completed with only 1%Â being mandatory

42%Â increase in overall talent and a 10%Â increase in promotions for active learners

Over 14K social interactions including likes, shares, pins and comments

Learning and communication

Sumo Group teamed up with Thrive to embed a learning platform they named DOJO. This would bring to life a self-directed, social learning culture and enable improved communication across the business. With Thriveâs handy auto-curation tools, the L&D team were able to launch with a range of curated content, covering topics including wellbeing, equality, diversity and inclusion. Within the first 30 days, 89% of Sumo's people logged in and contributed 414 pieces of user-generated content, and since launch, 89% of the content on DOJO has been user-generated, with a 95% engagement rate.

From May 2020 to March 2022:

DOJO usage increased by 98.3%

There were 80,000 logins, 309,750 content views, and 29,211 searches on the platform

Sumo's people completed 127,600 pieces of content, less than 1% of which was mandatory

They generated 14,300 social interactions, including likes, shares, pins and comments.

What's more, by highlighting L&D and DOJO during recruitment, they saw a 42% increase in overall talent, and a 10% increase in promotions compared to 2020-2021.

Spotify campaign to stay connected

Since launch, Sumo has delivered a range of creative learning initiatives to drive employee engagement. One campaign that was particularly popular was their DOJO Dukebox; a Spotify playlist embedded in Thrive with a weekly theme that learners can add songs to. This really brought their teams together and enabled their people to collaborate in social activities when working remotely, helping DOJO become not just the go-to place for learning, but the go-to social space for their people to connect.

From worlds apart to 'world class'

The positive impacts of DOJO were felt strongly in Sumo's employees' responses to The Sunday Times Top 100 Best Companies to Work For survey. From 2019 to 2021, Sumo's overall score went from 1 star (very good) to 3 stars (world-class). In 2022, they retained 3-star status and were named the 12th Best Large Company to Work For in the UK. Every survey category saw a sharp rise in scores, including 'personal growth', 'wellbeing' and 'leadership', showing DOJO accomplished what it set out to achieve: creating a place to meet others, share knowledge and develop through networks of learning.â

An award-winning relationship

After utilising the services of our in-house team of Data Analysts as a part of our Thrive Impact service, Sumo were able to prove the impact of their learning activity - leading to our partnership winning two awards. Firstly, the Digital prize at the 2022 Learning Excellence Awards, then silver in 'Best Use of Digital Technologies' at the 2022 UK Employee Experience Awards.

"Unanimously, Thrive came back as our provider of choice because of the great user experience, it was so easy to use and understand. We put it out to our people and asked how they felt about it.

Fast growth. Fresh challenges.

âAs Beauty Works expanded beyond its Cheshire roots to 100+ people in the UK, Ireland, Europe, the U.S., Dubai and Australia, communication broke down across locations and departments.Â Â

Comms were limited to all-user emails, training and policies were inconsistent, and their people were missing out on important updates about products, events, awards and much more.

The average user views 14 pieces of content a month

User adoption is at 87%

Over 80% engagement on new pieces of content

It was time for a makeover

The team began looking at a whole range of platforms, with a big emphasis on creating community and connection across the business.Â They wanted one digital space where all the answers - and all their experts - could be found at the click of a button. No matter the location. No matter the time zone.

Thrive caught their eye

âBeauty Worksâ Office Operations Manager Gemma Bray described Thrive as âmodern, fresh and easy to useâ, while Thrive Contentâs bite-sized resources made learning âso easyâ and were âa great cultural fit.â Our case studies with Beauty Worksâ industry peers, like DECIEM, highlighted the platformâs potential - and the rest, as they say, is history.

Introducing Agile Skills

âThe team had a launch party for their new Thrive platform, âBeauty Works Clickâ, at the beginning of May 2022.Â

Now, every individual at Beauty Works receives a personalised learning experience - from the warehouse to the sales team. Learning is based on real-time data that uncovers the trending and emerging skills that matter to them, both inside and outside of work.

One platform. All the answers.

âThrive connects Beauty Worksâ learners to the content needed to develop those skills - and the experts around the business who are well-versed in them. By creating community and collaborative knowledge sharing, Beauty Works has fostered a learning culture where their people can truly âClickâ.Thanks to the mobile app the platform has become their internal social media, bringing the whole company together while storing key updates, documents, policies and learning in one place.

Social learning for 10,000 learners

The L&D team at Brakes needed a more engaging platform that was accessible to everyone, from drivers and warehouse employees to their commercial teams. It had to be able to foster a social learning experience, align with the way people learn in their personal lives and support the delivery of a blended learning strategy.

Why Thrive instead of a traditional LMS?

When searching for a learning solution, Brakes wanted something that was both engaging and intuitive, while encouraging continuous personal development. It needed to be powerfully simple to use, so learners could pick it up straight away and want to return every day.Â Â

Thrive ticked all the boxes, and was quickly branded Athena after the goddess of wisdom. Laura House, Senior L&D Partner at Brakes commented:

75%Â user engagement in the first week of launch

Used to train staff in over 40 locations across the UK

80,000 content views a month from their staff

Supporting employee's remote working

Brakes soon launched Thrive to their contact centres in a phased rollout to maximise buy-in. Word quickly spread due to its success and impressive feedback, and the commercial team also wanted to get involved. The L&D team agreed to a wider roll out to commercial teams just as the COVID-19 global pandemic started. With the majority of their employees working from home for the first time, Brakes had to be reactive. They decided to fast track roll out to all 10,000 learners, including operational and frontline employees.

The team was able to quickly curate content and build learning pathways that supported their people and helped them navigate their way through the uncertain time. Using a range of different content including videos, live coaching sessions, micro-learning, articles and more, they could quickly provide training on relevant topics such as mental health, managing teams remotely and effective communication.

Brakes experienced an impressive 75% engagement in their first week after launch. Throughout lockdown and while many of their teams were furloughed, the L&D team managed to maintain engagement as Athena became the natural go-to destination for useful content. Looking to the future, the team plans to use Athena to continue supporting their remote workers.

They're also digitising their leadership training so they can deliver it virtually to employees, wherever they happen to be working. Due to the success of their partnership with Thrive, Brakes' parent company Sysco undertook a global rollout of the Learning Platform for 80,000 users.

Great Places Housing Group

Going from a traditional LMS to Thrive

With over 700 employees, Great Places attracts talent from all over the country. The launch of their new apprenticeship and graduate programme, Growing Greatness, saw Great Places experience a generational shift in their workforce.

They decided to review the technology they use across the company, and asked for feedback on their previous Totara LMS during their onboarding process. Employees felt the learning platform was outdated, difficult to use and didnât provide an instinctive user experience. Great Places wanted to upgrade their onboarding experience by providing a platform that would impress new starters, offer an intuitive experience, and reflect the businessâ social and collaborative learning culture.

Great Places wanted to move away from a learning platform that encouraged a solely compliance-based culture and implement something that encouraged social learning. Their vision was to create a knowledge base for employees, where they could easily contribute and share content themselves. They chose Thrive to completely replace their Totara LMS, as it was the only learning platform that could perfectly match social learning features with the traditional LMS functionality they needed.

With the variety of roles at Great Places they needed to offer a completely unique learning experience for every learner. Personalisation and machine learning are central to Thrive, which means their employees are recommended different content based on their skills and interests. The ability to look and feel like a social media platform ticked the boxes for Great Places. Thrive is powerfully easy to use, and the team didnât want a learning platform that needed detailed instructions to be able to use it. Â Great Placesâ migration process was straightforward and seamless; Thriveâs converter tool imported all their existing content and user data and ran it through their personalisation engine. So from day one, their learners were only seeing content relevant to them.

50% of L&D budget saved since switching to Thrive

3,083% increase in average content completions per month

33% of time saved onboarding new employees

Transforming onboarding and induction training

Great Places partnered up with Equity, taking their employee count from 600 people to 725. Following the partnership, they needed an efficient way to onboard over a hundred new staff members at once. Using Thrive, they converted their face-to-face onboarding programme into a digital learning pathway in just two weeks. It included a range of curated and created content such as welcome and meet the team videos, resources that shared their values and vision, customer success stories and lots more.

Thriveâs comments and questions features meant that Great Placesâ new learners had the ability to communicate with new and existing employees throughout their journey. The results? Over 70% of new starters were engaging in discussions or replying to content. This digital process saved the team a third of the time onboarding new starters, and has allowed them to easily review, adapt and evolve the journey as the company grows.

Bringing social learning to life

Thrive has helped Great Places bring a social learning culture to life in just a few months. Since launch, thereâs been a monumental shift in behavioural change as learners are engaging with 3,083% more content than their previous LMS.

- Naomi Edwards, L&D Administrator at Great Places Housing Group

Generating engagement has been a campaign-led approach for the team at Great Places. Theyâve leveraged Thriveâs campaigns feature to promote and run a range of learning initiatives including wellbeing support, Black History Month, working and managing teams from home and even keeping the kids entertained during lockdown. Going forward Great Places plan to continue driving engagement through campaigns that employees can get involved in, along with competitions that utilise the points and gamification elements of their Learning Platform.

Getting engagement up

Their previous Totara LMS with Learning Pool had limited LMS functionality, which presented several challenges around employee engagement and compliance training. The team at Dorset Council needed a more modern approach to learning and development, one that would provide a better return on investment and give their employees an engaging user experience.â

3,433 content views within the first week

85% user adoption within the first month

13 views on average by each user each month

Thrive was the answer

Dorset Councilâs L&D team chose to move away from a traditional learning management system and look for a more modern solution. An intuitive look and feel were essential to increase usability across the organisation. Lauren Gosson, L&D Consultant at Dorset Council shared why they chose Thrive:Â

As well as reporting and insights, one of the key features that stood out for Dorset Council is user generated content, as it's something that wasn't supported in their previous platform. The ability for learners to share useful resources with their colleagues will help the team at Dorset Council foster a social learning culture and extract knowledge from department silos.Â As a large organisation with many different services, they have also found pathways are a useful tool to target specific learning courses to different audiences which ensures their employees are up to date with compliance training.

âCountdown to launch

âThe upgrade process was seamless. In the run-up to launch, Dorset Council ran a countdown campaign releasing a series of comms and teaser videos that increased anticipation and excitement for the launch of their new platform. The first week after launch, their platform experienced an impressive 3,433 content views with their most popular topics including health and safety and equality and diversity.

A purpose-powered transformation

Elior is one of the UKâs leading contract caterers and an award-winning people business. Their 10,000-strong team delivers food to 1,200 sites - including care homes, schools, workplaces and stadiums. Their purpose? âTo enrich lives, everywhere, every day.â

But, they had a problem

Their traditional, face-to-face L&D approach began restricting peopleâs access to training as they expanded UK-wide. Busy schedules and travel times meant numbers dwindled. For those who did attend, it was difficult to retain a whole dayâs learning, and the travel and accommodation costs were huge. Â Whatâs more, managers were struggling to get the training resources they needed to support their teams. So Elior set out to overhaul their personal development and make it accessible and achievable for everyone - no matter their location, tech fluency, or commitments.

A modern, social solution

With an emphasis on connecting remote teams, creating a culture of collaborative knowledge sharing, and making learning resources available on-demand, Thrive ticked all the boxes. After the launch of Thrive@Elior in May 2021, everyone receives a personalised learning experience that suggests content to consume and colleagues to connect with - based both on the skills they already have, and those theyâre looking to develop. Any time. Any place. Any device.

Over 245,205 content views

Over 100,337 pieces completed

4,000 searches on the platform

Unlocking the platform's potential

From food safety to Pride Month, live cooking classes to menopause, Elior introduced âThrive Thursdayâ notifications to signpost key content for the week and drive engagement. Theyâve also used Thrive@Elior to run campaigns including gender diversity, recognition and feedback, modern slavery, Natashaâs Law, and a brilliant, company-first âWomentoringâ initiative.

Engagement. Impact. Everywhere.

Since launching in May 2021:

Thrive@Elior has had over 26,000 logins, 245,205 content views, and 4,000 searches on the platform.

â100,337 pieces of content have been completed, less than 1% of which are mandatory, showcasing a culture of true, self-directed learning.

Out of 3,239 total content items, 44% are user-generated.

There have been over 16,000 social interactions, including likes, comments, pins and shares.

Elior also used Thrive to move elements of their Chef School programme online - to brilliant effect:

The programme went from 9 months to 6 months, saving huge costs on travel and accommodation and fast-tracking new chefs into the business;

With pre-class content on the platform, students enter the kitchen prepared, confident, and ready to ask questions - improving food quality; and

Theyâve enrolled a much more diverse set of people, reaching new places and new learners, with some great stories around subtitled, replayable content making a world of difference to trainees with learning difficulties.

In short: Thrive@Elior has enriched lives, everywhere, every day. And long may that continue.

Challenges of traditional learning

Historically, Ted's training has been all about beautifully designed and printed induction tools, one-to-one coaching and off-site classroom training events which were bursting with personality. But with their more traditional approach came a range of barriers. They werenât able to truly engage their retail population, face-to-face workshops were restricted by location, and their printed guides were both difficult to keep up to date and didn't support Ted's commitment to sustainability.

Time to go digital and data-led

Ted Baker already knew their training had to become more digital and data-led, so they started building a business case. Then came the pandemic, meaning the team at Ted could no longer facilitate any face-to-face training, easily communicate to dispersed teams or keep their people connected to resources. They had to move quickly and find a new digital learning solution to replace their beautifully printed workbooks and classroom training - but it had to be something that could embody Ted's personality perfectly, while keeping their quirky approach to training alive.

Ted Baker sees a 676% leap in ROIÂ from their learning and development team

Ted Baker saves 150 trees over 5 years by digitising their learning guides

77% engagement within the first 2 months

Tedâs first-ever global HR technology

After a thorough tender process, Ted teamed up with Thrive to create one place for personal development, self-directed learning and communication. Â By launching their first-ever piece of global HR technology, the L&D team at Ted were able to widen access to retail teams, give their people a voice through user generated content, get important information out quickly and keep important resources up to date. Ted Bakerâs Digital Development Partner Debbie Frearson commented:

Ted's successful launch harnessed features like campaigns, events and questions to get their people connecting and sharing around the globe. They used pathways in five different languages to onboard learners onto the platform and first focused on topics such as their values, culture and community stories ahead of bringing in compliance training.

Since launch the team at Ted has seen impressive adoption, with up to 77% engagement, 140,000+ content views, and 57% of their content being shared by the employees themselves. What's more, by replacing their unique printed guides with a digital solution, they've boosted engagement, enjoyed a 676% return on investment, and will be saving 150 trees every 5 years!

Real results we can measure together

Inspiring self-led learning

From humble beginnings in 1988 to where they are now with over 200 stores in the UK, Ireland and the US, FatFace continues to grow. Their focus on building a modern learning experience for their employees brought them to Thrive. It was important to the L&D team that the emphasis was placed on the users to drive their own learning journey, and away from a top-down, âthis is what we think you needâ approach.

More than a learning platform

One of the big factors that drew the FatFace team to Thrive was the ability it gave them to cover so much more than basic learning. The team is using the platform as their internal communication tool to share news and collaborate, which is something they hadnât been able to do previously. When it comes to content, theyâre reaping the benefits of combining their own FatFace developed content with an enormous amount of external sources. The result has been a huge boost in engagement across the workforce.

The team has reached 20,000 content views

FatFace has achieved a 98% adoption rate for the platform

The engagement rate is 81% from their employees

Driving engagement with content variety

The different types of content that can be included in their learning initiatives had a huge impact on the L&D team at FatFace. From video to quizzes, memes to quotes, they have been able to get creative with the way they deliver their training. And this enthusiasm has transferred through to the learners as well, with increased engagement across the board.

A collaboration based on cultureâ

Leading digital transformation, cloud and cyber security company Injazat offers innovative end-to-end digital solutions and platforms, tailored to industry-specific needs both in the UAE and globally. Â

Injazat attended the People Development Summit in Dubai last year, with the intention to meet a variety of Learning Platform Vendors. They needed a provider that would support them in their mission to enhance their ecosystem of learning platforms, creating a true âLearner-Centricâ culture with a self-directed learning approach. Â

After careful consideration and identifying a closely aligned vision to deliver a seamless and modern learning experience, Injazat chose Thrive. They were confident that this solution would centralise access to learning across the business, as well as build a learning culture of true ownership. Â

To get them off to a flying start, Injazat also subscribed to Thrive Content. An off-the-shelf library of over 800+ campaign-led learning resources, Thrive Content features a wrap-around service that aligns content to Injazatâs specific objectives and maps to learning pathways that they create within Thrive.

75% user adoption within 6 weeks of go live.

20,000 content views a month.

Utilisation of four different languages within the platform

Injazat Digitises Learning Globally with ThriveLeading with launch

Going live in just 6 weeks, the team worked together on a successful launch campaign that saw up to 75% adoption and gave their 800+ learners access to content from an all-in-one home for learning.

Since launch, Injazat has focussed on delivering engaging campaigns to their learners. These campaigns are linked to identifiable skill gaps and learning pathways, bursting with Thrive Content resources and expert-led content on topics that truly matter to the business.

Effective leadership is one of the crucial parts of Injazat's overall employee experience. With Thrive in place, they now have the ability to target relevant audiences, deliver carefully curated programs, and host monthly campaigns on their ten leadership principles. These cover topics such as meeting culture, leading through change and coaching to bring out the best in others.Injazatâs VP of Talent Development Gary Hazel looks ahead to the future:

âLooking ahead to an exciting future

âThe Learning Team at Injazat is now working on a seamless integration with Thrive and Udemy to pull in even more fresh, curated content their learners can discover and engage with at their own pace.

With all the excitement of growth, it was clear to Huelâs people manager Vicki Bacon what they needed: a new way to scale onboarding to new starters wherever theyâre working; the ability to record and manage compliance; and the capability to help their people develop the critical skills they need to âhustle hard, work fastâ - one of Huelâs core values.

The team at Huel saw Thrive as the perfect solution to solve their challenges and then some. They soon realised they had the opportunity to create a one-stop-shop for learning as well as content and communication, which would be essential to power employee engagement. With Huelâs âspeedboat not oil tankerâ approach to working, speed of implementation was important to them when choosing a supplier. They saw a perfect fit in an exciting company that would grow as they do. Just like that, we partnered up with Vicki and the team to create Huel Learn!

Huel has achieved a 94% adoption rate

The team at Huel has shared over 5,226 pieces of content

56% of Huel's content is user generated

Transforming onboarding

Huel Learn was the answer to scale their onboarding experience, and get new Hueligans up to speed quickly whilst maintaining the quality and consistency of training. Vicki and the People Team at Huel built a world class onboarding pathway on Thrive, full of content that instantly makes new starters feel part of the team, wherever they might be working. This has saved time for their people across the board.

Huelâs modern L&D strategy takes a marketing approach that encourages learning to be more campaign and culture driven. Utilising the campaigns feature in Thrive, the team can promote focus topics and important talking points for their Hueligans to engage with. Whether itâs financial wellbeing, International Women's Day or Sustainability Week, campaigns link all the content together in one place to showcase it front and centre of their team's homepage. Vicki commented: âCampaigns are how we drive engagement at Huel. They take some of the noise away from other platforms that we might have used like Slack, our all-hands meetings and traditional email."

- Vicki Bacon, People Manager at Huel

Since launch, Huel Learn has achieved a 94% adoption rate and shared over 1,600 pieces of content. It has become their all-in-one place for learning, content and communication, which has made collaboration, personal development and real time learning more accessible for all Hueligans. There are plenty more inspirational learning campaigns and engagement initiatives coming up for Huel, and the team hit their 90% active users KPI within the first two months.

Time to transform L&D

Sky is Europeâs largest media company, with an impressive 23 million customers. When COVID-19 hit in March 2020, Sky had to close 60 retail stores and adopt remote working across all functions. But the leading company chose not to furlough employees, and instead approached the unprecedented time as a unique opportunity to prioritise and transform learning and development.

They needed a way to upskill, engage and deliver learning to 800+ retail staff and share leadership training with managers, supporting them through the transition and helping their teams adapt to change.

Their previous LMS didnât allow Sky to be agile, encourage user engagement or associate learning with communication. So, they defined the requirement for a new learning platform to guarantee usage, engage their teams and share important updates about COVID-19 - fast.â

Sky was midway through a pilot with Thrive when the pandemic hit, and all stakeholders made the decision to fast-track roll-out early with the following objectives:

- Create one single place for learning - Keep retail staff busy while stores across the country were closed - Upskill customer service group leaders with training to support their teams- Provide a platform where people can collaborate from home and stay connected

Thrive was launched across their retail teams within 2 weeks, and to business leaders within 6 weeks. The Sky team saved a huge amount of time on content curation by harnessing auto-curation tools within Thrive, as well as their microlearning content. By integrating this with their own content, they created blended learning pathways that supported end users through the ânew normalâ of working from home.

Sky has received 540K content views a month on their learning platform

Sky has received 90% employee engagement since launching Thrive

Sky's workforce is made up of 21,000 learners

Results and impact at Sky

Implementing Thrive has helped Sky achieve its objectives, and then some. Success lies in the reactivity of their L&D team, instant uptake from learners and the ability to streamline their platforms around the business.

Due to its success, Sky has now extended the roll-out to all contact centres and engineer front-line staff. By the end of June, Skyâs user count was 22,000+ employees from a standing start of 20 pilot users in mid-March.

Starting from scratch

Prior to discovering Thrive, LendInvest had no structured solution in place for their teams to develop new skills. As a result, there was a lack of access to relevant information and content, which culminated in a lack of development within teams.

A social-first solution

Enter Thrive. LendInvest was initially drawn to Thriveâs modern UX, but it was the rich content offering, social-first approach and seamless integration with Slack that sealed the deal for them.

With Thrive, LendInvest is able to foster a culture of self-driven learning and engagement among its employees. The platform's social learning features allows them to nurture a collaborative environment where employees and subject-matter experts can share their knowledge across the business. Learners have adapted to social learning so quickly that the team has already seen an uptick in user generated content, forming over 40% of their platform.

But Thrive isn't just about collaboration. LendInvest now has the perfect solution to manage onboarding, compliance, and communication within the business. They were able to streamline their mandatory training, events and compliance training by creating useful learning pathways bursting full of multi-media microlearning content.

Creating a self-directed learning culture

âThe impact was clear. With Thrive, everything is in one place and easily searchable, allowing the team to find the answers they need when they need them. As they can also track and ensure compliance, LendInvestâs Compliance Manager and Legal team use Thrive to share policies and documents.

Jessica Tang, Legal Council, commented:

LendInvest's employees also benefit from improved onboarding, making it easy for new starters to soak up induction materials and tasks they need regardless of where theyâre working. And with the platform's audience targeting features, theyâre able to recommend the most relevant content to each individual, making it a fully personalised onboarding experience.

Today, Thrive has become an integral part of LendInvest's self-directed learning culture. With 100% user coverage, over 21K views, and 116,844 points and achievements across the board, it's clear that Thrive has made a significant impact on LendInvest's workforce.

Real results we can measure together

Global learning and communication challenges

Before Thrive, DECIEMâs learning culture was heavily focused on face-to-face training. This had its challenges, including no way to refer back to learning content after the classroom session had finished. Employees were unable to learn in the flow of work and it was becoming timely and costly.

Whatâs more, nearly all of their online training and communication was historically delivered via email. This caused a lack of engagement amongst their workforce.

A DECIEM staff survey highlighted 78% of employees felt like they didnât know what was going on in the wider business and 42% felt they didn't have a voice

98% of employees wanted to learn more but only 48% felt they knew how to develop their skills

Employees missed out on important announcements and worked in silos with a lack of communication between different functions and locations

Workforce including retail, production and office workers

With a workforce including retail, production and office workers in over 15 different countries, DECIEM recognised the need for a tech-led learning approach to drive global inclusivity. A social and collaborative Learning Platform was the answer.

Thrive ticked all the boxes

DECIEM teamed up with Thrive to build a tech-led learning and development strategy, bringing to life a self-directed and co-constructed culture of learning and engagement.

Self led learning with 95% engagement

â¦with 95% active users, and each employee spending an average of 83 minutes per week on optional learning. Their âlearners as teachersâ approach has been so successful that their platform is now made up of 53% user generated content and only 23% content from the L&D team.

Internal perceptions and culture shift

DECIEM has seen an impressive behavioural shift amongst learners who naturally turn to Thrive to get the answers they need at the time they need them. A second sentiment survey revealed a huge increase in employee satisfaction and attitude towards learning and communication.

Since launching Thrive in 2019, DECIEM has maintained over 95% user coverage, with over 50% of the platformâs content being generated by the learners themselves.

The platform has become a cornerstone of DECIEMâs culture. Itâs helped them bring to life the values at the companyâs core and create one, central place for its people to learn about products, meet the leadership team, connect with internal experts and develop the skills that matter to them.

As a result, their internal engagement survey scores in cultural areas like psychological safety and inclusivity have stayed strong, healthy, and on the rise.

Evolving your learning strategy

We can migrate any of your below content formats: E-Learning (SCORM 1.2, SCORM 2004, TinCan, xAPI, CMI5) Word processor files (.pdf) Video files (.mp4, .mpg, .wmv, .avi, .mov, .webm) Image files (.png, .jpg, .gif, .svg) Articles Links

The metadata required alongside the files would be: Unique Identifier File name Content Title (3 - 100 characters) Description (Up to 1000 characters) publishedAt (Date) Language (if applicable.) File name is important and can be used as the ID between the file and the metadata.

We can migrate from any LMS, LXP or learning platform youâre using. As long as we have cooperation from your current provider and you have the right agreement in place for us to access and transfer your data over, we can do it.

Yes! Not only is Thrive completely responsive, but we also have a mobile app which enables front line employees to make the best use of the platform wherever they work. Download this on the App Store or Google Play Store.

Yes, single-sign-on comes as standard with Thrive giving your learners a seamless log-in experience and we also support non-email users. For integrations, we support the following standards for integrations of various kinds: SAML2, SCIM2, xAPI and SCORM 1.2. Alongside these, we offer a webhook interface for performing various actions and a RESTful API for querying data on the system. This gives you the freedom to integrate a variety of tools such as HR systems, CRMs, data analysis tools and comms tools such as Teams and Slack.

Thrive auto-detects language preferences and is available in 20+ different languages including English, German, French, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, Swedish and many more.

The time it takes to complete migration and onboarding depends on your involvement and speed in which we can access the data from your current platform. We typically see companies who are focused complete the transition within two and a half months but others may take longer depending on your migration and implementation approach. Fun fact: Our quickest implementation has been 30 days and the longest 126 days!

SCORM, PDFs, MP3, webpages, MP4, YouTube, web-links, questions, articles, quizzes, broadcasts and so much more.

Thrive has replaced hundreds of traditional LMSs migrating customers from Learning Pool, Kallidus, SAP Litmos, Looop, Totara, Fuse, Cornerstone and so many more. Our modern-day learning platform combines all the compliance requirements of the traditional LMS with features such as AI-powered personalisation, user-generated content, comms, skills and a social media-like user experience. However, we understand sometimes a platform can be very embedded into your organisation. Although it performs best alone, Thrive can be plugged over the top of an existing LMS, ensuring you can still give your learners that stellar, modern learning experience.

What makes Thrive different?

When we win, we win together.

We are the all-in-one solution to your problems

Who said you canât have it all? Because Thrive does. Since launching in 2019 as the first-ever Learning Experience Platform (LXP), weâve evolved. Although we're still deeply rooted to the principles of social knowledge sharing, personalised experiences and world-class UX, weâve grown into so much more.

Over the years, we've teamed up with customers like Vodafone, Sky and Matalan to solve common challenges around skills and comms. More recently, we've launched Thrive AI, a game-changing suite of AI-powered features that helps you create content in the click of a button, and surface answers for your users in minutes. Â Today, weâre proud to be used by hundreds of global companies.

Hundreds of companies. 99% customer retention.

We put learners first - always

It's true. Pretty much every other LMS youâll encounter has been built for technical admins. Even if they market an âLXP inspired user-interface,â itâll be plugged on top of a legacy way of learning. Thatâs why itâs no surprise learners are notoriously disengaged and unmotivated to learn.Â

However, we've flipped the script. Building a new Learning Platform from scratch meant we could create something based on real-learner research and feedback that emulates the consumer-grade, point of need, desirable UI experiences your learners expect - and thatâs why they love it!

We know the people behind our people

Thrive is more than a career. Itâs part of your journey. We know our families and loved ones help us be the best versions of ourselves, and thatâs why bringing them along for the ride is a must.Â

We do this by encouraging flexibility, recognising work-life balance is a priority and a juggling act, and even including all the Thrive kids in our crazy culture-centric anticsâ¦

With a community-first mindset and a hunger to always do the right thing, Helen Marshall our CLO, identified a crucial gap: women in L&D and HR did not have many safe spaces to share and learn beyond their organisations. It was time to make a change and band together.

Founded by Thriveâs CLO, Helen Marshall, we cultivated a vibrant community of over 250 strong members in just two months. Today, WomenIn is a dynamic space where individuals from various backgrounds, including L&D, HR, OD, recruitment and coaching, come together to make a difference. Through networking, knowledge sharing, online events and meet-ups, WomenIn is a safe space for so many to ideate, upskill, grow confidence and so much more.

We love one-of-a-kind experiences

We go big on experiences. Our annual user conference is all about bringing the Thrive magic to life. With our passion to bring people together and belief that we have something to learn from everyone, itâs the only event in the industry that invites the business world to give their perspective on L&D.

With previous guests including Steven Bartlett, Grace Beverly, Stuart Broad, Jacqueline Gold, Karren Brady and Mo Gawdat, it really is a one-of-a-kind experience you wonât find anywhere else.

No task is too big for our migration tool

âNo matter which LMS youâre using, weâre well experienced in helping organisations big and small migrate from their existing solution. We built an LMS migration tool that imports your users, completion history and content directly from your current learning platform into Thrive, so you and your learners donât miss a thing.

Your stress-free migration journey

It may be a tool weâre using, but weâre with you every step of the way, guiding you through the process as part of your implementation and onboarding phase.

Our LMS migration tool is designed specifically to help L&D teams move their legacy learning history from platforms at the click of a button. This means your new Learning Platform will be complete with all your tracked learning records from day one.

Whether itâs videos, SCORM files, pdfs, articles or presentations, your content is what keeps your LMS alive and fresh so we understand you donât always want to start from scratch. Weâll make sure when you switch your LMS all your content items are fully intact - you can use it as an opportunity to tidy up your tagging strategy too!

Of course, Thrive uses single-sign on to authenticate users based on the identify management software you use, but if your use case is more complex for example you might be supporting non-email users, you can import all the users from your current platform directly into Thrive for a seamless admin and learner experience.

All your answers upfront

We can migrate any of your below content formats: E-Learning (SCORM 1.2, SCORM 2004, TinCan, xAPI, CMI5) Word processor files (.pdf) Video files (.mp4, .mpg, .wmv, .avi, .mov, .webm) Image files (.png, .jpg, .gif, .svg) Articles Links

The metadata required alongside the files would be: Unique Identifier File name Content Title (3 - 100 characters) Description (Up to 1000 characters) publishedAt (Date) Language (if applicable.) File name is important and can be used as the ID between the file and the metadata.

We can migrate from any LMS, LXP or learning platform youâre using. As long as we have cooperation from your current provider and you have the right agreement in place for us to access and transfer your data over, we can do it.

The time it takes to complete migration and onboarding depends on your involvement and speed in which we can access the data from your current platform. We typically see companies who are focused complete the transition within two and a half months but others may take longer depending on your migration and implementation approach. Fun fact: Our quickest implementation has been 30 days and the longest 126 days!

Accessibility Statement for Thrive

Last updated: 17 July 2024

âMeasures to Support Accessibility

Thrive Learning takes the following measures to ensure the accessibility of Thrive Learning Platform:Â

Include accessibility throughout our internal policies.

Integrate accessibility into our procurement practices.

Provide continual accessibility training for our staff.

Assign clear accessibility goals and responsibilities.

Employ formal accessibility quality assurance methods.

Include diverse candidates within our user testing.

Our current accessibility strategy also includes a component update project. In this initiative, we will replace older user interface components with new MUI (Material UI) components. These new components adhere to accessibility standards more effectively and will serve as the foundation for further accessibility improvements in the future.

We welcome your feedback on the accessibility of the Thrive Learning Platform. Please let us know if you encounter accessibility barriers on the Thrive Learning Platform by logging a ticket with our Support Team.

If you are an end user of our Thrive platform, please reach out to your organisational representative who can engage our Support Team to provide the feedback.

Compatibility with browsers and assistive technology

Thrive Learning Platform is designed to be compatible with the following assistive technologies:

Dragon Naturally Speaking

Thrive Learning Platform is not compatible with:

Firefox, Safari and Chrome versions older than 2 major versions.

Internet Explorer is no longer supported.

Mobile operating systems older than 2 years.

âTechnical specifications

Accessibility of Thrive Learning Platform relies on the following technologies to work with the particular combination of web browser and any assistive technologies or plugins installed on your computer:

These technologies are relied upon for conformance with the accessibility standards used.

Thrive Learning assessed the accessibility of the Thrive Learning Platform by the following approaches:

Regular internal reviews by qualified team members

Annual external evaluation with accessibility audit performed by Zoonou Ltd.

The next full accessibility audit with Zoonou Ltd. is scheduled for 2025 while we aim to complete the component update project.

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) defines requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. The Thrive Learning Platform is partially conformant with WCAG 2.2 AA/EN 301 549. Partially conformant means that while we work to the standards as much as possible, some parts of the system do not fully conform to the accessibility standard, see a full list of non-compliances below.

Limitations and alternatives

We are committed to continually improving the accessibility of the Thrive Learning Platform. However, some areas remain that are not fully accessible. As outlined in the âMeasures to Support Accessibilityâ section, the component update project will inherently address many of these non-compliances. Below is a list of known limitations of the Thrive Learning Platform:

When using a screen reader, a small number of elements do not have correct accessible names/labels, meaning default or generic names will be read. We are continuing to improve these labels with each new release of the application.

Some areas of the user interface include elements being used in a non-semantic way which can result in the page structure not being interpreted correctly. We are continuing to improve these issues with each new release of the application.

While our colour contrast meets AA standards in most areas, there are exceptions:

Large Text: Large-scale text and images of large-scale text must have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.

Incidental: Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component, purely decorative, not visible to anyone, or part of a picture with significant other visual content have no contrast requirement.

Logotypes: Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no contrast requirement.

Some colour choices are within the control of the user, so we advise customers to theme their sites with strongly contrasting colours. We will be implementing further options for high-contrast displays in the future.

Images do not have appropriate alternative text.

Pre-recorded videos do not have text or audio alternatives, however, a feature update has enabled the support of subtitles and captions for video content.

Some page content is unable to be interacted with using keyboard navigation.

The text will not reflow in a single column when you change the size of the browser window.

The tabbing order of the platform may not always be logical.

A visible tab focus indicator is not always present when tabbing page content.

Not all error messages are announced as they are displayed when using a screen reader.

The page titles are not descriptive.

Zooming text only to 200% may cause some content to be difficult to read.

HTML validation errors are present, which may introduce issues for users navigating with assistive technologies.

We canât guarantee the accessibility of all content on the platform because this might be third-party content, this includes:

Videos (manual uploads of vtt. files for subtitles and captions are supported)

Thrive will be entitled to use Feedback for any purpose without restriction or remuneration of any kind.

4. Term and terminationÂ

This Agreement is effective until terminated or until your access to or use of the Service is terminated (whichever is earlier) by any person, including Customer, the Third Party Platform Provider or Thrive. This Agreement shall terminate immediately and automatically upon any termination of the Customer Agreement, and upon such termination, Customer, including you, shall cease all use of the Apps. Termination of this Agreement shall not entitle Customer or you to any refund, credit, or other compensation from Thrive.

5. Service level commitment and support

Thrive shall determine, in its sole discretion, the level of support it will provide for the Apps, if any, and any such support shall be subject to change without notice.

Thrive expressly disclaims any and all representations, warranties and conditions, express or implied, including without limitation, representations, warranties and conditions of quality, performance, results, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or title, non-infringement of third party rights, and those arising by statute or otherwise in law or from a course of dealingÂ or use of trade.

Thriveâs entire liability, regardless of the form of action, whether based on contract or tort, including, without limitation, negligence, fundamental breach, or failure of the essential purpose of the agreement, shall in no event exceed the amount paid by you for the apps. Thrive reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to the apps at any time without notice. In no event will Thrive be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to the apps. Thrive may also impose limits on the use of or access to the apps, in any case and without notice or liability.

This Agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act does not apply to this Agreement, the application of both being expressly excluded.

This Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of England and Wales. Each party irrevocably agrees that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims).

(i) in whole or in part, or subcontract or delegate its obligations under this Agreement, to an Affiliate, andÂ

(ii) in its entirety, without your consent, to its successor in interest in connection with a sale of all or substantially all assets or equity.Â

No waiver of any provision of this Agreement will constitute a continuing waiver of such provision or a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement.
